December 2005

TO: $\quad$ Members of the American Academy of Actuaries and Other Persons Interested in Risk Classification (for All Practice Areas)

FROM: $\quad$ Actuarial Standards Board (ASB)

SUBJ: $\quad$ Actuarial Standard of Practice (ASOP) No. 12

This booklet contains the final version of a revision of ASOP No. 12, now titled Risk Classification (for All Practice Areas).

## Background

In 1989, the Actuarial Standards Board adopted the original ASOP No. 12, then titled Concerning Risk Classification. The original ASOP No. 12 was developed as the need for more formal guidance on risk classification increased as the selection process became more complex and more subject to public scrutiny. In light of the evolution in practice since then, as well as the adoption of a new format for standards, the ASB believed it was appropriate to revise this standard in order to reflect current generally accepted actuarial practice.

## Exposure Draft

The exposure draft of this ASOP was approved for exposure in September 2004 with a comment deadline of March 15, 2005. Twenty-two comment letters were received and considered in developing the final standard. A summary of the substantive issues contained in the exposure draft comment letters and the responses are provided in appendix 2.

The most significant changes from the exposure draft were as follows:

1. The task force clarified language relating to the interaction of applicable law and this standard.
2. The task force revised the definition of "adverse selection."
3. The task force reworded the definition of "financial or personal security system" and included examples.
4. The words "equitable" and "fair" were added in section 3.2.1 but defined in a very limited context that is applicable only to rates.

## ASOP No. 12-December 2005

5. With respect to the operation of the standard, the task force added language that clarifies that this standard in all respects applies only to professional services with respect to designing, reviewing, or changing risk classification systems.
6. Sections 4.1 and 4.2 were combined into a new section 4.1, Communications and Disclosures, which was revised for clarity. The placement of communication requirements throughout the proposed standard was examined, and a sentence regarding disclosure was removed from section 3.3.3 and incorporated into section 4.1. A similar change was made by adding a new sentence in section 4.1 to correspond to the guidance in section 3.4.1.

In addition, the disclosure requirement in section 4 for the actuary to consider providing quantitative analyses was removed and replaced by a new section 3.4.4, which guides the actuary to consider performing such analyses, depending on the purpose, nature, and scope of the assignment.

The task force thanks everyone who took the time to contribute comments on the exposure draft.

The ASB voted in December 2005 to adopt this standard.

ACTUARIAL STANDARD OF PRACTICE NO. 12

## RISK CLASSIFICATION (FOR ALL PRACTICE AREAS)

## STANDARD OF PRACTICE

## Section 1. Purpose, Scope, Cross References, and Effective Date

1.1 Purpose-This actuarial standard of practice (ASOP) provides guidance to actuaries when performing professional services with respect to designing, reviewing, or changing risk classification systems.

1.2 Scope - This standard applies to all actuaries when performing professional services with respect to designing, reviewing, or changing risk classification systems used in connection with financial or personal security systems, as defined in section 2.4, regarding the classification of individuals or entities into groups intended to reflect the relative likelihood of expected outcomes. Such professional services may include expert testimony, regulatory activities, legislative activities, or statements concerning public policy, to the extent these activities involve designing, reviewing, or changing a risk classification system used in connection with a specific financial or personal security system.

Throughout this standard, any reference to performing professional services with respect to designing, reviewing, or changing a risk classification system also includes giving advice with respect to that risk classification system.

Risk classification can affect and be affected by many actuarial activities, such as the setting of rates, contributions, reserves, benefits, dividends, or experience refunds; the analysis or projection of quantitative or qualitative experience or results; underwriting actions; and developing assumptions, for example, for pension valuations or optional forms of benefits. This standard applies to actuaries when performing such activities to the extent such activities directly or indirectly involve designing, reviewing, or changing a risk classification system. This standard also applies to actuaries when performing such activities to the extent that such activities directly or indirectly are likely to have a material effect, in the actuary's professional judgment, on the intended purpose or expected outcome of the risk classification system.

If the actuary departs from the guidance set forth in this standard in order to comply with applicable law (statutes, regulations, and other legally binding authority), or for any other reason the actuary deems appropriate, the actuary should refer to section 4 .

1.3 Cross References - When this standard refers to the provisions of other documents, the reference includes the referenced documents as they may be amended or restated in the

## ASOP No. 12-December 2005

future, and any successor to them, by whatever name called. If any amended or restated document differs materially from the originally referenced document, the actuary should consider the guidance in this standard to the extent it is applicable and appropriate.

1.4 Effective Date-This standard will be effective for any professional service commenced on or after May 1, 2006.

## Section 2. Definitions

The terms below are defined for use in this actuarial standard of practice.

2.1 Advice-An actuary's communication or other work product in oral, written, or electronic form setting forth the actuary's professional opinion or recommendations concerning work that falls within the scope of this standard.

2.2 Adverse Selection-Actions taken by one party using risk characteristics or other information known to or suspected by that party that cause a financial disadvantage to the financial or personal security system (sometimes referred to as antiselection).

2.3 Credibility — A measure of the predictive value in a given application that the actuary attaches to a particular body of data (predictive is used here in the statistical sense and not in the sense of predicting the future).

2.4 Financial or Personal Security System-A private or governmental entity or program that is intended to mitigate the impact of unfavorable outcomes of contingent events. Examples of financial or personal security systems include auto insurance, homeowners insurance, life insurance, and pension plans, where the mitigation primarily takes the form of financial payments; prepaid health plans and continuing care retirement communities, where the mitigation primarily takes the form of direct service to the individual; and other systems, where the mitigation may be a combination of financial payments and direct services.

2.5 Homogeneity - The degree to which the expected outcomes within a risk class have comparable value.

2.6 Practical-Realistic in approach, given the purpose, nature, and scope of the assignment and any constraints, including cost and time considerations.

2.7 Risk(s)-Individuals or entities covered by financial or personal security systems.

2.8 Risk Characteristics - Measurable or observable factors or characteristics that are used to assign each risk to one of the risk classes of a risk classification system.

2.9 Risk Class - A set of risks grouped together under a risk classification system.

## ASOP No. 12-December 2005

2.10 Risk Classification System-A system used to assign risks to groups based upon the expected cost or benefit of the coverage or services provided.

## Section 3. Analysis of Issues and Recommended Practices

3.1 Introduction-This section provides guidance for actuaries when performing professional services with respect to designing, reviewing, or changing a risk classification system. Approaches to risk classification can vary significantly and it is appropriate for the actuary to exercise considerable professional judgment when providing such services, including making appropriate use of statistical tools. Sections 3 and 4 are intended to provide guidance to assist the actuary in exercising professional judgment when applying various acceptable approaches.

3.2 Considerations in the Selection of Risk Characteristics -Risk characteristics are important structural components of a risk classification system. When selecting which risk characteristics to use in a risk classification system, the actuary should consider the following:

3.2.1 Relationship of Risk Characteristics and Expected Outcomes - The actuary should select risk characteristics that are related to expected outcomes. A relationship between a risk characteristic and an expected outcome, such as cost, is demonstrated if it can be shown that the variation in actual or reasonably anticipated experience correlates to the risk characteristic. In demonstrating a relationship, the actuary may use relevant information from any reliable source, including statistical or other mathematical analysis of available data. The actuary may also use clinical experience and expert opinion.

Rates within a risk classification system would be considered equitable if differences in rates reflect material differences in expected cost for risk characteristics. In the context of rates, the word fair is often used in place of the word equitable.

The actuary should consider the interdependence of risk characteristics. To the extent the actuary expects the interdependence to have a material impact on the operation of the risk classification system, the actuary should make appropriate adjustments.

Sometimes it is appropriate for the actuary to make inferences without specific demonstration. For example, it might not be necessary to demonstrate that persons with seriously impaired, uncorrected vision would represent higher risks as operators of motor vehicles.

3.2.2 Causality-While the actuary should select risk characteristics that are related to expected outcomes, it is not necessary for the actuary to establish a cause and

## ASOP No. 12-December 2005

effect relationship between the risk characteristic and expected outcome in order to use a specific risk characteristic.

3.2.3 Objectivity-The actuary should select risk characteristics that are capable of being objectively determined. A risk characteristic is objectively determinable if it is based on readily verifiable observable facts that cannot be easily manipulated. For example, a risk classification of "blindness" is not objective, whereas a risk classification of "vision corrected to no better than 20/100" is objective.

3.2.4 Practicality-The actuary's selection of a risk characteristic should reflect the tradeoffs between practical and other relevant considerations. Practical considerations that may be relevant include, but are not limited to, the cost, time, and effort needed to evaluate the risk characteristic, the ongoing cost of administration, the acceptability of the usage of the characteristic, and the potential usage of different characteristics that would produce equivalent results.

3.2.5 Applicable Law-The actuary should consider whether compliance with applicable law creates significant limitations on the choice of risk characteristics.

3.2.6 Industry Practices-When selecting risk characteristics, the actuary should consider usual and customary risk classification practices for the type of financial or personal security system under consideration.

3.2.7 Business Practices - When selecting risk characteristics, the actuary should consider limitations created by business practices related to the financial or personal security system as known to the actuary and consider whether such limitations are likely to have a significant impact on the risk classification system.

3.3 Considerations in Establishing Risk Classes - A risk classification system assigns each risk to a risk class based on the results of measuring or observing its risk characteristics. When establishing risk classes for a financial or personal security system, the actuary should consider and document any known significant choices or judgments made, whether by the actuary or by others, with respect to the following:

3.3.1 Intended Use-The actuary should select a risk classification system that is appropriate for the intended use. Different sets of risk classes may be appropriate for different purposes. For example, when setting reserves for an insurance coverage, the actuary may choose to subdivide or combine some of the risk classes used as a basis for rates.

## ASOP No. 12-December 2005

3.3.2 Actuarial Considerations - When establishing risk classes, the actuary should consider the following, which are often interrelated:

a. Adverse Selection-If the variation in expected outcomes within a risk class is too great, adverse selection is likely to occur. To the extent practical, the actuary should establish risk classes such that each has sufficient homogeneity with respect to expected outcomes to satisfy the purpose for which the risk classification system is intended.

b. Credibility-It is desirable that risk classes in a risk classification system be large enough to allow credible statistical inferences regarding expected outcomes. When the available data are not sufficient for this purpose, the actuary should balance considerations of predictability with considerations of homogeneity. The actuary should use professional judgment in achieving this balance.

c. Practicality—The actuary should use professional judgment in balancing the potentially conflicting objectives of accuracy and efficiency, as well as in minimizing the potential effects of adverse selection. The cost, time, and effort needed to assign risks to appropriate risk classes will increase with the number of risk classes.

3.3.3 Other Considerations - When establishing risk classes, the actuary should (a) comply with applicable law; (b) consider industry practices for that type of financial or personal security system as known to the actuary; and (c) consider limitations created by business practices of the financial or personal security system as known to the actuary.

3.3.4 Reasonableness of Results - When establishing risk classes, the actuary should consider the reasonableness of the results that proceed from the intended use of the risk classes (for example, the consistency of the patterns of rates, values, or factors among risk classes).

3.4 Testing the Risk Classification System-Upon the establishment of the risk classification system and upon subsequent review, the actuary should, if appropriate, test the long-term viability of the financial or personal security system. When performing such tests subsequent to the establishment of the risk classification system, the actuary should evaluate emerging experience and determine whether there is any significant need for change.

3.4.1 Effect of Adverse Selection-Adverse selection can potentially threaten the long-term viability of a financial or personal security system. The actuary should assess the potential effects of adverse selection that may result or have resulted from the design or implementation of the risk classification system. Whenever the effects of adverse selection are expected to be material, the actuary should, when

## ASOP No. 12-December 2005

practical, estimate the potential impact and recommend appropriate measures to mitigate the impact.

3.4.2 Risk Classes Used for Testing—The actuary should consider using a different set of risk classes for testing long-term viability than was used as the basis for determining the assigned values if this is likely to improve the meaningfulness of the tests. For example, if a risk classification system is gender-neutral, the actuary might separate the classes based on gender when performing a test of long-term viability.

3.4.3 Effect of Changes - If the risk classification system has changed, or if business or industry practices have changed, the actuary should consider testing the effects of such changes in accordance with the guidance of this standard.

3.4.4 Quantitative Analyses-Depending on the purpose, nature, and scope of the assignment, the actuary should consider performing quantitative analyses of the impact of the following to the extent they are generally known and reasonably available to the actuary:

a. significant limitations due to compliance with applicable law;

b. significant departures from industry practices;

c. significant limitations created by business practices of the financial or personal security system;

d. any changes in the risk classes or the assigned values based upon the actuary's determination that experience indicates a significant need for a change; and

e. any expected material effects of adverse selection.

3.5 Reliance on Data or Other Information Supplied by Others - When relying on data or other information supplied by others, the actuary should refer to ASOP No. 23, Data Quality, for guidance.

3.6 Documentation-The actuary should document the assumptions and methodologies used in designing, reviewing, or changing a risk classification system in compliance with the requirements of ASOP No. 41, Actuarial Communications. The actuary should also prepare and retain documentation to demonstrate compliance with the disclosure requirements of section 4.1.

## ASOP No. 12-December 2005

## Section 4. Communications and Disclosures

4.1 Communications and Disclosures-When issuing actuarial communications under this standard, the actuary should comply with ASOP Nos. 23 and 41. In addition, the actuarial communications should disclose any known significant impact resulting from the following to the extent they are generally known and reasonably available to the actuary:

a. significant limitations due to compliance with applicable law;

b. significant departures from industry practices;

c. significant limitations created by business practices related to the financial or personal security system;

d. a determination by the actuary that experience indicates a significant need for change, such as changes in the risk classes or the assigned values; and

e. expected material effects of adverse selection;

f. the disclosure in ASOP No. 41, section 4.2, if any material assumption or method was prescribed by applicable law (statutes, regulations, and other legally binding authority);

g. the disclosure in ASOP No. 41, section 4.3, if the actuary states reliance on other sources and thereby disclaims responsibility for any material assumption or method selected by a party other than the actuary; and

h the disclosure in ASOP No. 41, section 4.4, if, in the actuary's professional judgment, the actuary has otherwise deviated materially from the guidance of this ASOP.

The actuarial communications should also disclose any recommendations developed by the actuary to mitigate the potential impact of adverse selection.

## ASOP No. 12-December 2005

## Appendix 1

## Background and Current Practices

Note: The following appendix is provided for informational purposes but is not part of the standard of practice.

## Background

Risk classification has been a fundamental part of actuarial practice since the beginning of the profession. The financial distress and inequity that can result from ignoring the impact of differences in risk characteristics was dramatically illustrated by the failure of the nineteenthcentury assessment societies, where life insurance was provided at rates that disregarded age. Failure to adhere to actuarial principles regarding risk classification for voluntary coverages can result in underutilization of the financial or personal security system by, and thus lack of coverage for, lower risk individuals, and can result in coverage at insufficient rates for higher risk individuals, which threatens the viability of the entire system.

Adverse selection may result from the design of the classification system, or may be the result of externally mandated constraints on risk classification. Classes that are overly broad may produce unexpected changes in the distribution of risk characteristics. For example, if an insurer chooses not to screen for a specific risk characteristic, or a jurisdiction precludes screening for that characteristic, this may result in individuals with the characteristic applying for coverage in greater numbers and/or amounts, leading to increased overall costs.

Risk classification is generally used to treat participants with similar risk characteristics in a consistent manner, to permit economic incentives to operate and thereby encourage widespread availability of coverage, and to protect the soundness of the system.

The following actuarial literature provides additional background and context with respect to risk classification:

1. In 1957, the Society of Actuaries published Selection of Risks by Pearce Shepherd and Andrew Webster, which educated several generations of actuaries and is still a useful reference.
2. In 1980, the American Academy of Actuaries published the Risk Classification Statement of Principles, which has enjoyed widespread acceptance in the actuarial profession. At the time of this revision of ASOP No. 12, the American Academy of Actuaries was developing a white paper regarding risk classification principles.
3. In 1992, the Committee on Actuarial Principles of the Society of Actuaries published "Principles of Actuarial Science," which discusses risk classification in the context of the principles on which actuarial science is based.

## ASOP No. 12-December 2005

## Current Practices

Over the years, a multitude of risk classification systems have been designed, put into use, and modified as a result of experience. Advances in medical science, economics, and other disciplines, as well as in actuarial science itself, are likely to result in continued evolution of these systems. While future developments cannot be foreseen with accuracy, practicing actuaries can take reasonable steps to keep abreast of emerging and current practices. These practices may vary significantly by area of practice. For example, the risk classes for voluntary life insurance may be subdivided to reflect the applicant's state of health, smoking habits, and occupation, while these factors are usually not considered in pension systems.

Innovations in risk classification systems may engender considerable controversy. The potential use of genetic tests to classify risks for life and health insurance is a current example. In some cases, such controversy results in legislation or regulation. The use of postal codes, for example, has been outlawed for some types of coverage. For the most part, however, the legal test for risk classification has remained unchanged for several decades; risk classification is allowed so long as it is "based on sound actuarial principles" and "related to actual or reasonably anticipated experience.”

Risk classification issues in some instances may pose a dilemma for an actuary working in the public policy arena when political considerations support a system that contradicts to some degree practices called for in this ASOP. Also, when designing, reviewing, or changing a risk classification system, actuaries may perform professional services related to a designated set of specific assumptions that place certain restraints on the risk classification system.

In such situations, it is important for those requesting such professional services to have the benefit of professional actuarial advice.

This ASOP is not intended to prevent the actuary from performing professional services in the situations described above. In such situations, the communication and disclosure guidance in section 4.1 will be particularly pertinent, and current section 4.1(e), which requires disclosure of any known significant impact resulting from expected material effects of adverse deviation, may well apply. Section 4.1(a), which relates to applicable law, and section 4.1(b), which relates to industry practices, may also be pertinent.

## Appendix 2

## Comments on the Exposure Draft and Responses

The exposure draft of this revision of ASOP No. 12, Risk Classification for All Practice Areas, was issued in September 2004 with a comment deadline of March 15, 2005. Twenty-two comment letters were received, some of which were submitted on behalf of multiple commentators, such as by firms or committees. For purposes of this appendix, the term "commentator" may refer to more than one person associated with a particular comment letter. The task force carefully considered all comments received. Summarized below are the significant issues and questions contained in the comment letters and the responses, which may have resulted from ASB, General Committee, or task force discussion. Unless otherwise noted, the section numbers and titles used below refer to those in the exposure draft.

| GENERAL COMMENTS |  |
| :---: | :---: |
| Comment | Several commentators suggested various editorial changes in addition to those addressed specifically <br> below. |
| Response | The task force implemented such suggestions if they enhanced clarity and did not alter the intent of the <br> section. |
| Comment | One commentator noted that the ASOP should deal with the ability of an insured to misrepresent or <br> manipulate its classification. |
| Response | The task force believed that the considerations raised by the commentator are adequately addressed by <br> sections 3.2.3 and 3.2.4. |
| Comment | One commentator thought that a section on public and social policy considerations should be added to <br> the standard. |
| Response | The task force believed that social and public policy considerations, while essential aspects of the way <br> the public views the profession, did not belong in an ASOP dealing with the actuarial aspects of risk <br> classification. |
| Comment | One commentator questioned whether the ASOP would apply to company selection criteria (tiering <br> criteria) and schedule-rating criteria that may be part of a rating scheme. |
| Response | The task force believes that the ASOP applies to the extent the selection or schedule rating criteria, used <br> by a company as part of the risk classification system, creates the potential for adverse selection. |
| Comment | One commentator believed that the ASOP could conflict with proposed state legislation to ban credit as <br> a rating variable and suggested adding an additional consideration in section 3 that the actuary should <br> select risk characteristics in order to avoid controversy or lawsuits. |
| Response | The task force believes it has addressed issues regarding applicable law, industry practices, business <br> practices, and testing the risk classification system under various scenarios. |
| Comment | In the transmittal memorandum of the exposure draft, the task force asked whether the key changes from <br> the previous standard were appropriate. |
| Response | Several commentators responded that the changes were appropriate and some suggested additional <br> changes that are discussed in this appendix. |

## ASOP No. 12-December 2005

| Response | One commentator expressed concern regarding the expansion of scope and the implications in actuarial <br> work that would be otherwise unrelated to risk classification and the expansion of scope to the public <br> policy arena in general. <br> The task force has added modified wording in the standard to clarify that in all cases the standard applies <br> only in respect to design, reviewing, or changing risk classification systems related to financial or <br> personal security systems. |
| :---: | :---: |
| Comment | Two commentators believed that the revised standard should discuss the purposes of risk classification <br> similar to the discussion in the previous standard. One commentator noted the discussion about <br> encouraging "widespread availability of coverage" in particular. |
| Response | The task force retained a brief discussion of the purposes of risk classification in appendix 1 but did not <br> believe it was appropriate for the ASOP to provide additional education about the purposes of risk <br> classification. The task force noted that a white paper on risk classification that could contain such <br> material is being developed. |
| Comment | Several commentators noted that the previous ASOP No. 12 had been very useful in court proceedings <br> and recommended that the task force retain some of the wording in section 5 of the previous ASOP. One <br> commentator suggested strengthening the revised standard so that actuarial testimony would be given <br> greater weight by the courts in interpreting rate standards. Another commentator suggested <br> strengthening the ASOP by adding an explicit statement that one objective during the development and <br> use of risk classification systems is to minimize adverse selection. |
| Response | The task force reviewed the revised standard with these concerns in mind but concluded that the revised <br> standard represents current generally accepted practice and provides an appropriate level of guidance. <br> The task force considered the specific suggestions with respect to additional wording and incorporated <br> some of the wording regarding adverse selection from the old section 5.5 into appendix 1. |
| ment | In the transmittal memorandum of the exposure draft, the task force asked whether it was appropriate for <br> the ASOP not to use the terms "equitable" and "fair." Two commentators believed that the ASOP should <br> use or define these concepts because they have been used in court proceedings, but the majority of <br> commentators believed that it was appropriate not to define them and that the standard adequately <br> addressed these concepts. |
| Response | The task force agreed that the ASOP should not define subjective qualities such as "equitable" and <br> "fair." As the result of ASB deliberation on this issue, language was added to section 3.2.1 to discuss <br> what was meant by the terms "equitable" and "fair." These terms are intended to apply to a risk <br> classification system only to the extent the risk classification system applies to rates. As such, a formal <br> definition was not added. Court decisions notwithstanding, there is no general agreement as to what <br> characterizes "equitable" classification systems or "fair" discrimination. The task force also considered <br> the possibility that further discussions about such issues might become part of the proposed white paper <br> on risk classification that the American Academy of Actuaries is developing. |
| Comment | One commentator questioned why the standard offered separate guidance for "risk characteristics" <br> (section 3.2) and "risk classes" (section 3.3). Another commentator believed there should be greater <br> differentiation between the concepts of "risk characteristic" and "risk classification." |
| Response | The task force believed that the ASOP uses these terms appropriately and made no change. |
| Comment | One commentator thought that section 3.3 .2 should include guidance on appropriately matching the risk <br> with the outcome when establishing a risk class. |
| Re: | The task force believed that section 3.2 .1 addressed this comment and noted that section 3.3.2(a) <br> requires sufficient homogeneity with respect to outcomes. |

## ASOP No. 12-December 2005

| Section 1.2, Scope |  |
| :---: | :---: |
| Comment | In the transmittal memorandum of the exposure draft, the task force asked whether it was appropriate to <br> include the actuary's advice within the scope of the standard. Several commentators agreed that <br> including guidance on actuarial advice was appropriate. One commentator believed that the disclosure <br> requirements in section 4 could be burdensome to an actuary who has provided brief oral advice. |
| Response | The task force kept actuarial advice within the scope of the standard and intended that the disclosure <br> requirements in section 4 should apply to any actuarial advice that falls within the scope of the standard. |
| Comment | One commentator questioned what was meant by "legislative activities" as an example of a professional <br> service. |
| Response | The task force intended that "legislative activities" could include drafting legislation, for example. |
| Comment | Several commentators questioned the meaning of "personal security system." One commentator <br> questioned whether the definition of "financial or personal security system" would exclude share-based <br> payment systems from the scope of the standard. The commentator recommended that the standard be <br> revised to include such systems. |
| Response | The task force intended that the ASOP should apply if share-based payment systems or stock options <br> were part of a financial or personal security system, as defined in the section 2.5. If such plans were not <br> part of a financial or personal security system, the ASOP would not apply. The task force chose not to <br> expand the scope to include such plans in all situations but did clarify the definition of "financial or <br> personal security system." |
| SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS |  |
| Comment | One commentator suggested that a definition of experience be included, citing the definition of <br> "experience" in the previous ASOP (old section 2.5), which includes the wording, "Experience may <br> include estimates where data are incomplete or insufficient." |
| Response | The task force agreed that experience may include estimates where data are incomplete or insufficient <br> but did not believe that the old definition was necessary in the revised ASOP. |
| Comment | One commentator suggested that a definition of "reasonable" be included. |
| Response | The task force disagreed and did not add a definition of "reasonable.” |
| Section 2.1, Advice |  |
| Comment | One commentator suggested that "other work product” was not needed, since the standard already listed <br> "an actuary’s oral, written, or electronic communication." |
| Response | The task force revised the language to clarify that "communication or other work product" was intended. |
| Comment | One commentator believed that a definition for "advice" is not needed. |
| Response | The task force disagreed and retained the definition of advice. |
| Section 2.2, Adverse Selection |  |
| Comment | In the transmittal memorandum of the exposure draft, the task force asked if the definition of "adverse <br> selection" was appropriate or whether an alternative definition (included in the transmittal letter) would <br> be preferable. Many commentators responded, some agreeing with the original, some with the <br> alternative, and some suggested other wording. The other wording was most often to change the phrase, <br> "take financial advantage of." |
| Response | The task force believed that some of the reasoning on the part of the commentators who preferred the <br> current version did not accurately describe adverse selection. The task force ultimately decided to use <br> the alternative definition in the standard and believed that it better addressed some commentators' <br> concerns that the other definition could have a negative connotation with respect to motivation. |


| Comment | One commentator suggested that "antiselection" is synonymous with adverse selection and that should <br> be made clear in the definition. <br> The task force agreed and added that reference. |
| :---: | :---: |
| Section 2.4, Credibility (now 2.3) |  |
| Comment | Two commentators believed that within the definition of "credibility" the language concerning <br> "predictive" was confusing. |
| Response | The task force retained the definition as it is used in several other ASOPs. |
| Section 2.5, Financial or Personal Security System (now 2.4) |  |
| Comment | Several commentators questioned the meaning of "personal security system." |
| Response | The task force clarified the definition. |
| Comment | One commentator suggested that "impact" be modified to read "financial impact." |
| Response | The task force disagreed and revised the definition of “financial and security systems" to delineate the <br> impacts. |
| Section 2.6, Homogeneity (now 2.5) |  |
| Comment | One commentator believed the definition of "homogeneity" needed revisions to include the concept of <br> grouping similar risks. Another commentator found the definition unclear. |
| Response | The task force believes that the current definition is appropriate for this ASOP. |
| Section 2.7, Practical (now 2.6) |  |
| Comment | One commentator believed the definition of "practical" was much too broad and needed to be more <br> actuarial in nature. Alternatively, the commentator suggested dropping it and relying on section 3.2.4. |
| Response | The task force believed the definition was appropriate and made no change. Section 3.2 .4 addresses <br> actuarial practice with respect to practicality. While "practical" is used there and in other places, it is <br> always modified by its context. |
| Section 2.8, Risk(s) (now 2.7) |  |
| Comment | One commentator suggested that the definition of risks as individuals or entities seemed too limiting and <br> noted that covered risks can also include pieces of property or events. |
| Response | The task force disagreed, believing that "entity" could encompass property and events. |
| Comment | One commentator suggested that a unit of risk be defined at the basic unit of risk. |
| Response | The task force disagreed and made no change. |
| Section 2.9, Risk Characteristics (now 2.8) |  |
| Comment | One commentator suggested defining risk characteristics as "measurable or observable factors or <br> characteristics, each of which is measured by grouping similar risks into risk classes." |
| Response | The task force disagreed and made no change. |
| Section 2.11, Risk Classification System (now 2.10) |  |
| Comment | One commentator believes the definition of "risk classification system" is circular since "classify" is <br> used in the definition. |
| Response | The task force agreed and revised the wording. |
| Comment | One commentator recommended that the term "risks" be changed to "similar risks" in this definition <br> just as in the old definition of risk classification that used the phrase "grouping risks with similar risk <br> characteristics." |
| Response | The task force disagreed and made no change. |
| Comment | One commentator suggested replacing "groups" with "classes." |
| Response | The task force disagreed and made no change. |

## SECTION 3. ANALYSIS OF ISSUES AND RECOMMENDED PRACTICES

## Section 3.2.1, Relationship of Risk Characteristics and Expected Outcomes

Comment $\quad$ One commentator expressed concern with the standard's differentiation between the section's quantitative and subjective factors.

Response The task force did not intend to be prescriptive as to how to quantify the ratings scheme and believed that the ASOP was sufficiently specific. The ASOP does not address rate adequacy. Selection is the focus, not quantification.

Comment One commentator believed that "clinical" was not an appropriate adjective to describe the experience an actuary is allowed to use.

Response The task force intentionally used the term "clinical."

Comment One commentator believed that if the classification cannot be measured by actual insurance data, then it is not really a risk classification system.

Response The task force disagreed and made no change.

Comment One commentator suggested that the three points addressing why risk classification is generally used be moved to background information.

Response The task force agreed that such educational language was more appropriate in an appendix than in the body of the ASOP and has moved it.

Comment One commentator believed that it may be difficult to deal with the process and procedures involved with considering the interdependence of risk characteristics and their potential impact on the operation of the risk classification system.

Response The task force did not change the language to address this comment but notes that section 3.2.4 addresses considerations regarding practicality.

## Section 3.2.2, Causality

Comment A number of commentators expressed concern with establishing a cause-and-effect relationship while others thought the standard did not go far enough in this regard.

Response The task force agreed that, where there is a demonstrable cause-and-effect relationship between a risk characteristic and the expected outcome, it is appropriate for the actuary to include such a demonstration. However, the task force recognized that there can be significant relationships between risk characteristics and expected outcomes where a cause-and-effect relationship cannot be demonstrated.

## Section 3.2.4, Practicality

Comment $\quad$ Two commentators suggested the use of examples of practical considerations.

Response The task force revised the section to indicate that the language shows examples of practical considerations.

Comment One commentator suggested that "theoretical," as used in section 3.2.4, be defined.

Response The task force replaced "theoretical" with "other relevant."

Section 3.2.5, Applicable Law

Comment One commentator thought that the proposed language in this section was much too broad.

Response The task force disagreed with the comment and made no change.

| Comment | One commentator expressed concern that the documentation requirements for these considerations <br> represented an increase from the previous version. |
| :---: | :---: |
| Response | The task force thought the documentation requirements were appropriate and necessary and made no <br> change. |
| Section 3.3.1, Intended Use |  |
| Comment | One commentator noted that stratifying data sets in loss reserving is different from risk classification, <br> which is done to price risks, and believed that loss reserving permits more flexibility. The commentator <br> stated that the definition of a risk classification system does not apply to loss reserving. <br> The task force agreed with the first concepts but disagreed with the final sentence and therefore made no <br> change. |
| Section 3.3.2, Actuarial Considerations |  |
| Comment | With respect to section 3.3.2(a), one commentator suggested replacing the word "for" in the first line <br> with "within" for clarification. <br> The task force agreed and made the suggested change. |
| Comment | With respect to section 3.3.2(b), two commentators questioned what was intended by the use of the term <br> "large enough." <br> The task force believed the language was sufficiently clear and made no change. |
| Comment | One commentator pointed out that there are often classes that, individually, have associated experience <br> with low statistical credibility and believed that alternatives to credibility should be included in section <br> 3.3.2(b). |
| Response | While the task force agreed that there are situations in which actuarially sound classification plans will <br> have individual classes where the experience has low statistical credibility, the task force believed that <br> credibility is a desirable characteristic of risk classes within a risk classification system and that no <br> expansion to include alternatives was necessary. |
| Comment | One commentator suggested replacing "statistical predictions" with "predictions" in section 3.3.2(b) to <br> avoid the implication that underlying statistics were required. Another commentator suggested that the <br> term "predictions" needed explanation. |
| Response | The task force agreed with these comments and replaced "predictions" with "inferences" and edited the <br> language to improve its clarity. |
| Comment <br> Response | One commentator suggested that the last sentence of section 3.3.2(b), while accurate, was irrelevant. <br> The task force agreed and eliminated the sentence. |
| Comment | With respect to section 3.3.2(c), one commentator suggested the need for definitions of "accuracy" and <br> "efficiency." |
| Response | The task force believed that the existing language regarding the actuary's professional judgment was <br> sufficient in determining the meaning of "accuracy" and "efficiency" and did not add a definition of <br> either word. |


| Comment | Several commentators suggested that section $3.3 .2(\mathrm{~d})$ be eliminated. A number of those commentators <br> also pointed out that the language was both inconsistent with current actuarial practice and inappropriate <br> as an implied requirement. <br> The task force agreed and deleted the section. |
| :---: | :---: |
| Section 3.3.3, Other Considerations |  |
| Comment | Several commentators pointed out that the last sentence of the section was unclear and might <br> inadvertently require a degree of testing and determination that was not intended. |
| Response | The task force deleted the last sentence of the section. In addition, section 4.1, Communications and <br> Disclosures, was clarified as to what disclosures are appropriate. |
| Section 3.3.4, Reasonableness of Results |  |
| Comment | One commentator found the parenthetical wording confusing. |
| Response | The task force believed the examples were appropriate and made no change. |
| Comment | One commentator found this section ambiguous in the context of establishing risk classes. Another <br> commentator suggested that a cost-based definition of reasonable be added or that the section be deleted <br> entirely. |
| Response | The task force retained the section but clarified the wording by mentioning the intended use of the risk <br> classes. The task force did not believe additional clarification of "reasonableness" was necessary <br> because reasonableness is a subjective concept that may depend on the actuary's professional judgment. <br> The task force also notes that the Introduction to the Actuarial Standards of Practice discusses this <br> concept in further detail. |
| Section 3.4, Testing the Risk Classification System |  |
| Comment | One commentator indicated that it may be preferable to substitute the word "or" for "and" on the second <br> line so that the sentence reads, "Upon establishment of the risk classification system or upon subsequent <br> review...." |
| Response | The task force did not agree and believed the word "and" was appropriate because testing should be <br> carried out both upon establishment and upon subsequent review. |
| Comment | One commentator wanted to substitute "continuing" for "long-term" viability in the second line. The <br> commentator believed that the usual issue is the current and near-future viability of a system, not its <br> long-term prognosis. Also, another commentator said that the requirement to "test long-term viability" is <br> new and questioned its meaning. |
| Response | The task force considered alternative wording but ultimately decided that the existing wording best <br> reflected that the actuary should check the risk classification system for viability both in the short-term <br> and in the long-term. |

## ASOP No. 12-December 2005

| Comment | One commentator believed that testing the system is set out as something the actuary should do, if <br> appropriate, rather than as something the actuary should consider. The commentator believed that the <br> paragraph implied a duty to test in some situations, without describing explicitly what those situations <br> would be (i.e., when testing would be "appropriate”). The commentator suspected that the situations <br> described in sections 3.4.1-3.4.3 were the kind of situations that the task force had in mind as situations <br> where long-term testing would be "appropriate.” However, as currently written, the commentator <br> thought that a stronger duty could be implied. The commentator suggested that section 3.4 itself should <br> read, “...the actuary should consider testing the long-term viability of the risk classification system. ..." <br> The task force believed that the existing wording conveyed the concept that the actuary considers <br> whether testing is appropriate and made no change. |
| :---: | :---: |
| Section 3.5, Reliance on Data Supplied by Others (now Reliance on Data or Other Information Supplied by <br> Others) |  |
| Comment | One commentator believed that the provision for reliance on data supplied by others was not needed in <br> this ASOP because ASOP No. 23, Data Quality, addresses this. |
| Response | This task force agreed and revised the section to refer to ASOP No. 23, using wording consistent with <br> other recently adopted ASOPs and exposure drafts. |
| SECTION 4. COMMUNICATIONS AND DISLOSURES |  |
| Section 4.1, Communications (now Communications and Disclosures) |  |
| Comment | One commentator suggested changing the phrase "when issuing actuarial communications under this <br> standard" to "when issuing actuarial communications that include elements of actuarial work within the <br> scope of this standard." <br> The task force retained the original language to be consistent with other ASOPs. |
| Section 4.2, Disclosures (now 4.1, Communications and Disclosures) |  |
| Comment | One commentator stated that some of the disclosures, notably section 4.2(a) and 4.2(c) (now 4.1(a) and <br> 4.1(c)), are impractical, since they might require the actuary to begin with the universe and then disclose <br> everything that is not utilized. The commentator suggested replacing these disclosure requirements with <br> a communication that defends the choice of risk classification system and notes in that defense how <br> compliance with applicable law and business practices affected the selection, rather than describing all <br> the alternatives that would have been available in the absence of such constraints. <br> The task force did not agree that the requirement to disclose significant limitations required a discussion <br> of all alternatives that would have been available in the absence of legal or business constraints. The task <br> force noted that the listed disclosures proceed from considerations required in section 3 and modified the <br> wording of the disclosure requirements to be more consistent with that section, including revising the <br> lead-in sentence to require disclosure of the significant impact of such considerations. |
| Comment | One commentator stated that the disclosure issue is heightened by the expansion of scope into the public <br> policy arena and stated that excessive disclosure requirements may weaken the actuary's ability to <br> influence the discussion of public policy. |
| Response | The task force disagreed with the comment and noted that, while the scope of the standard now includes <br> regulatory activities, legislative activities, and statements regarding public policy, the scope does so only <br> in the context of the performance of professional services. |

## ASOP No. 12-December 2005

| Response | One commentator suggested deleting section 4.2(a) (now 4.1(a)), which requires disclosure of <br> significant limitations due to compliance with applicable law, noting that other ASOPs have tended not <br> to include this requirement except where the limitations seriously distort the work product. <br> The task force disagreed with this comment, noting that significant limitations on the choice of risk <br> characteristics are likely to distort the risk classification system and therefore should be disclosed. |
| :---: | :---: |
| Comment | Several commentators expressed opinions regarding the requirement that the actuary should disclose <br> whether quantitative analyses were performed relative to items being disclosed. One commentator <br> expressed strong objection to this requirement, asserting that the requirement would be counter- <br> productive and would reduce the number of quantitative analyses being done. Another commentator <br> agreed and noted that the disclosure issue was heightened by the expansion of scope to the public policy <br> arena, where an advocacy position may be taken. A third commentator objected to the requirement to <br> disclose that quantitative analyses were not done but suggested requiring that any analyses that were <br> done be summarized. A fourth commentator suggested exempting certain of the required disclosures <br> from the requirement to consider quantification. A fifth commentator pointed out that, while the actuary <br> was required to disclose whether quantitative analyses were performed, the actuary was only required to <br> consider providing the results of those analyses in the disclosure. |
| Response | The disclosure requirement for the actuary to consider providing quantitative analyses of the impact of <br> the items being disclosed was removed, and instead similar wording was added as a new section 3.4.4, <br> Quantitative Analyses, which guides the actuary to consider performing such analyses, depending on the <br> purpose, nature, and scope of the assignment. |
| Comment | In the transmittal letter for the exposure draft in request for comment \#6, the task force asked whether <br> there were any situations in which the requirement in section 4.2(c) (now $4.1(\mathrm{c})$ ) to disclose any <br> significant limitations created by business practices of the financial or personal security system would <br> not be appropriate. Two comments were received, both agreeing with the appropriateness of the <br> requirement. |
| Response | The task force retained the requirement. |
| Comment | Two commentators suggested substituting "indicates" for "creates" in section 4.2(d) (now 4.1(d)). |
| Response | The task force agreed, changed the wording as suggested, and made other revisions for clarity. |
| Comment | In the transmittal letter for the exposure draft in request for comment \#7, the task force asked whether <br> the requirement in 4.2(e) (now 4.1(e)) to disclose the effects of adverse selection was appropriate. Three <br> commentators addressed this request for comment, and all agreed the requirement was appropriate. <br> However, one commentator suggested that there be no requirement to quantify the impact. |
| Response | The task force retained the requirement in what is now $4.1(\mathrm{e})$ and also removed the requirement to <br> consider providing quantitative analyses. Additionally, the task force deleted section $4.2(\mathrm{f})$ after <br> determining that it was already covered by ASOP No. 41 , Actuarial Communications, to which section <br> 4.1 refers. |
| APPENDIX (now Appendix 1) |  |
| Comment | One commentator expressed concern with the citing of the textbook Selection of Risks by Shepherd and <br> Webster. |
| Response | The task force believed that citing the Shepherd and Webster book was appropriate but added a new <br> lead-in sentence to the citation to indicate that the references cited provide additional background and <br> context with respect to risk classification. |
