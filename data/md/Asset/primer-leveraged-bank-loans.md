## Leveraged Bank Loans Primer

Analyst: Jennifer Johnson

## Executive Summary

- Leveraged bank loans are lent to companies with high-yield credit quality (rated below investment grade) by a group of lenders. Within a company's capital structure, leveraged bank loans rank the highest in terms of payment priority and are considered senior secured credit.
- Pricing leveraged bank loans is typically set as a spread based off a reference rate, such as prime or the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR).
- Broadly syndicated loans (BSLs) are the largest portion of the leveraged bank loan market; they are syndicated by originating banks to investors. BSLs can be in the form of pro rata loans or institutional bank loans.
- Investors in institutional bank loans include collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), mutual funds and insurance companies.
- In addition to BSLs, middle market loans-generally, loans to companies with less than or equal to $\$ 500$ million in gross revenues and less than or equal to $\$ 50$ million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) - are a subset of the leveraged loan market. Middle market loans are generally smaller in size than BSLs.


## What Are Leveraged Bank Loans?

FitchRatings ${ }^{1}$ defines a leveraged bank loan as "a commercial loan to a high-yield company provided by a group of lenders"; they are typically senior secured debt (secured by company, or borrower, assets) and are at the top of a company's capital structure (see Chart 1). Leveraged bank loans are often floating rate and priced at a spread over a referenced rate. They are generally issued with maturities of seven to eight years but can be prepaid sooner. There are different views as to why they are termed "leveraged": one is because of the below investment grade credit quality, another is because they are used to fund leveraged buyouts or refinance debt. BSLs are the largest segment of the leveraged bank loan market, and they are the predominant loan type included in CLO portfolios.[^0]

Leveraged bank loans are originated with covenants, which are restrictions on what the borrower can and cannot do relative to the loan terms, throughout the life of the loan. These include financial, or maintenance, covenants that require the borrower to maintain certain financial measures. An example of a financial covenant is the debt service coverage ratio, whereby the borrower is required to maintain sufficient funds to cover all debt payments. Leveraged bank loans also have positive/affirmative covenants (indicating what actions the borrower must take to remain compliant with the loan terms) and negative covenants (restricting or limiting what the borrower can do to remain compliant with loan terms). An example of a positive/affirmative covenant is paying interest on the leveraged bank loan; an example of a negative covenant is limiting new debt issuance.

## Basic Background on Leveraged Bank Loans

Leveraged bank loans are comprised of institutional bank loans and pro-rata loans (the latter of which include revolving credit facilities that allow borrowers to draw down funds, repay them and draw down again) as shown in Chart 2. Investors in pro-rata loans are primarily banks and other financing companies. Investors in institutional loans (which, for the most part, are term loans) include CLOs, mutual funds and insurance companies. According to FitchRatings, the institutional leveraged bank loan market has experienced record growth in recent years, totaling more than $\$ 1.1$ trillion outstanding across more than 1,600 issuers at year-end 2017 -reaching record highs.

According to FitchRatings, the leveraged bank loan market has doubled in size since 2012. Investor interest in leveraged bank loans has been fueled by expectations of continued interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, as increasing interest rates tend to elevate investor interest in floating rate investments, such as leveraged bank loans. CLOs are the largest investor of leveraged bank loans, according to Leveraged Commentary \& Data (LCD), an S\&P Global Market Intelligence offering. ${ }^{2}$

Chart 3 shows how the leveraged bank loan market has grown and been impacted by capital markets events since the financial crisis. In particular, record growth occurred following the financial crisis due to increased investor demand as a result of the search for yield.

## Leveraged Bank Loan Pricing

The yield on leveraged bank loans is floating rate based on a referenced rate such as prime or the LIBOR; in particular, the three-month LIBOR. The spread takes into account the bank loan's credit quality, liquidity and market technicals (such as supply and demand). The reference rates to which loans are priced change periodically; that is, they can be reset daily (as is the case with prime), monthly or yearly, for example. Loans that are considered to be smaller in size in terms of execution (i.e., \$200 million or less), are usually priced at a premium (higher than) to larger loans. ${ }^{3}$ And, as the Federal Reserve has been increasing the fed funds rate (or the rate at which depository institutions lend to each other), leveraged loans have become a more attractive investment because their yield increases as interest rates rise.

## Leveraged Bank Loans vs. High-Yield Bonds

Credit spreads on leveraged bank loans are usually larger than investment grade bonds but smaller than high-yield bonds, as "[t]he greater yield versus investment grade reflects greater perceived credit risk of bank loans, while the slightly lower yield relative to high-yield is the result of bank loans' higher position in the capital structure." 4 There are other significant differences between leveraged bank loans and high-yield bonds, some of which are shown in Table 1 below.

## Table 1:

Exhibit 5: Comparison of Leveraged Loans and High Yield Bonds

|  | Leveraged Loans | High Yield Bonds |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Interest Rate/Coupon | Floating Rate | Fixed rate |
| Rating | Below investment grade | Below investment grade |
| Security | Typically senior secured | Generally unsecured |
| Priority | Senior | Subordinate |
| Callability | Generally no, pre-payable at <br> par without penalty | Usually call protected |
| Term | 5-9 years | 7-10 years |
| Amortization | Required quarterly principal <br> payments | Bullet payment at maturity |

In addition, because of differences in characteristics and terms, leveraged bank loans tend to have lower default rates than high-yield bonds, and due, in part, to their senior position within a company's capital structure along with protection from covenants, they have higher recovery rates. ${ }^{5}$[^2]

## Primary vs. Secondary Markets

Leveraged bank loans may be sold in the primary (new issuance) or secondary markets, typically to banks and other institutional investors, such as insurance companies. The secondary market is where financial instruments trade after they have been initially issued and sold, and are no longer considered new issues. Secondary market leveraged bank loan sales typically occur through dealers at large banks. Leveraged bank loans are actively traded on the secondary market.

## Types of Leveraged Bank Loans

Common traits among leveraged bank loans include that these loans are rated BB+ or lower, they are floating rate based off a referenced rate, they are secured and they are structured by a group of banks referred to as a "syndicate." Leveraged bank loans are also key components for corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and leveraged buyout (LBO) activity. A few of the common types of leveraged bank loans in the market are discussed below; they are also the predominant types of loans that are included as collateral for CLOs.

## Covenant-Lite ("Cov-Lite")

Cov-lite generally refers to loans with loose financial maintenance covenants; that is, borrowers are not required to maintain certain financial performance measures throughout the life of the loan. There are also variations of cov-lite whereby covenants are loosely set or are only triggered for a certain portion of the loan. The financial covenants are intended to provide an "early-warning" mechanism to lenders of a potentially deteriorating credit situation. FitchRatings research cites that the emergence of cov-lite loans in late 2012 (since the financial crisis), is due to the evolution of the investor base and increased sophistication of the lending market. According to FitchRatings, cov-lite loans have comprised the majority of newly issued leveraged loans, and they have become the norm in the institutional leveraged market. Cov-lite loans are typically used for leveraged buyouts and other large, sophisticated loan transactions and are typically issued in the form of term loans. In 2017, cov-lite loan issuance reached a peak of $\$ 742$ billion, the majority of which (17\%) were in the technology industry.

## Second-Lien Loans

Second-lien loans are "second-in-line" for any post-bankruptcy recoveries, after first-lien loans; that is, claims are junior to those of first-lien. Second-lien loans are typically highly leveraged and low in credit quality (single B to CCC rating categories) and, therefore, considered risker than first-lien loans. Second-lien loans are more attractive than first-lien from a yield perspective. In addition, appetite for second-lien loans increases when a search for higher yield occurs, such as in a continued low interest rate environment. The attractiveness of second-lien loans moves in tandem with market volatility and investors' risk appetite. They are typically issued as a term loans. CLO portfolios may contain a limited amount of second-lien loans as specified in the transaction's investment guidelines. According to FitchRatings research, new issuance of second-lien loans reached a peak of $\$ 39.2$ billion peak in 2007.

## Middle Market Loans

While the definition may vary slightly acorss different sources, middle market loans are generally made to companies with less than, or equal to, $\$ 500$ million in gross revenues and less than, or equal to, $\$ 50$ million in

EBITDA. ${ }^{6}$ Middle market loans are a subset of the leveraged bank loan market. FitchRatings research identifies a few lenders of middle market loans to include CLOs, business development companies (BDCs), alternative asset managers, credit oppportunity funds and regional banks. Middle market loans are generally less than $\$ 500$ million in size.

## Primary Investors in Bank Loans

As shown in Chart 4, consistently over the years since at least 2009, CLOs have been the largest investor leveraged bank loans. Post-financial crisis, CLOs were considered "survivors," with investors not having experienced significant defaults due in part to the credit enhancement provided by the structures. While hedge funds, distressed and high-yield funds have decreased their investments in leveraged bank loans - perhaps seeking opportunities in alternative investments for higher yields -insurance companies' direct investment in leveraged bank loans appears to have remained relatively consistent.

## What Are the Risks?

When investing in leveraged bank loans, appetite for risk should take into consideration the credit rating assigned to the leveraged loan (or the issuer) by one or more of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs), as the ratings represent the NRSRO's assessment of the loan's (issuer's) credit risk, or the risk that the issuer will default on making timely principal and/or interest payments on the loan. Leveraged bank loans and/or the companies that issue them, are typically assigned speculative grade credit ratings ( $\mathrm{BB}+$ and lower), reflecting the NRSROs' opinions regarding the loan's collateral coverage, seniority in the company's capital structure (typically senior secured), industry trends and company management, among other factors. All of these[^3]characteristics determine the likelihood that the borrower will be able to pay interest and principal on a timely basis. "Loss-given - default" is the portion of credit risk that measures the severity of the loss if the borrower were to default; as leveraged bank loans are typically senior secured, the holders usually have first priority among the company's creditors in the event impairment occurs, and often they are able to renegotiate with the company/issuer before the loan becomes severely impaired.

Liquidity is another risk that could arise when investing in leveraged bank loans. Leveraged bank loans that are liquid, or that trade relatively easily and quickly without impacting the market price, tend to be priced with narrow spreads over the referenced rate. As previously mentioned, pricing leveraged bank loans takes into consideration the bank loan's credit quality, as well as market-based factors. In addition, large loans (those greater than $\$ 200$ million in size) are typically priced at a narrower spread than smaller loans, as the ability to package and sell loans is in high demand (i.e., more liquid), resulting in smaller loans being priced at a premium. In addition, at times, leveraged bank loans may experience "technical pressure" in the secondary market, resulting in reduced liquidity that, in turn, affects the bank loan price. For example, as investors react to industry and/or market events, forced sales can result in price declines.

Leveraged bank loans are subject to market risk, or the risk of a market decline that, in turn, reduces their value. As such, investors in leveraged bank loans mark-to-market the value of their loans; that is, they obtain price data from broker-dealers or mark-to-market services to assess the price with which they might receive if they had to sell the loan at a moment's notice. This trend has resulted in more transparency within the leveraged bank loan market and, in turn, valuing leveraged bank loans has become more efficient.

Prepayment risk on leveraged bank loans may also occur as interest rates decrease, and bank loan issuers refinance higher-yielding coupons for lower yields. Conversely, as interest rates rise, borrowers may experience challenges making payments on the bank loans resulting in delinquencies and/or defaults (i.e., credit risk).
