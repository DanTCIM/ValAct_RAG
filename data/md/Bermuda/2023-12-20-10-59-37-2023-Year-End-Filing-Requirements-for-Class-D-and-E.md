## NOTES:

1. The CSR may be reported in the currency the insurer deems as appropriate.
2. The CSR should be filed within four months after the end of the financial year or such longer period, not exceeding seven months, as the Authority may determine on the application of the insurer.
3. Declaration of capital and solvency return should be signed by two directors and the insurer's principal representative.
4. The FCR should be signed by the i) chief executive of the insurer and any ii) senior executive responsible for actuarial, risk management, internal audit or compliance function. The FCR is to be published on the insurer's website within 14 days of the date the report was filed with the Authority. If an insurer does not have a website, it is to furnish to the public a copy of its latest FCR within 10 days of receipt of a request made in writing.
5. Both an electronic version and a printed copy of the CSR must be submitted which will include the SFR Forms. For an insurer to submit an electronic version only, the Authority will require insurers to submit via the "submit" macro embedded within the BSCR model. To ensure this is working properly, we encourage an insurer's information technology (IT) department to work with the Authority on the submit functionality prior the submission deadline.

## NOTES:

For the 2023 year-end, insurers are required to complete the BSCR based on both the 2018 year-end methodology and the revised 2019 year-end CSR calculation (both methodologies are included in the latest release of the BSCR model) If an insurer wishes to determine their capital charge based on the revised methodology only, insurers are required to apply for permission via email request to RiskAnalytics@bma.bm.

## Bermuda Long-Term Commercial Insurers

## Changes to the 2023 BSCR Model

Below are the changes from the 2022 to 2023 year-end model for Long-Term insurers:

1) For insurers that report under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 17, please complete Forms 1ASFS Statutory Balance Sheet, Form 2ASFS Statutory Statement of Income, and Form 8ASFS Statutory Statement of Capital and Surplus;
2) Schedule V(e) - Stress/Scenario Tests

a) Reporting basis has been amended for consolidated statutory basis to consolidated Economic Balance Sheet (EBS) basis;

b) Financial Market Scenario -

i. Updated rates for Stress Scenarios Tests R3, R4, R6, R7 and R8;

ii. R8 Inflation and Monetary Policy - table for input to each scenario type;

iii. R9 Long-Term Liquidity Stress Test Scenario - inclusion of updated stress scenario instructions.

c) Mortgage Loan Stress Test - requirement has been removed for Class C, D and E insurers.

3) Schedule VI - Schedule of Fixed Assets - has been updated based on industry feedback to clarify the reporting requirements and number of entry cells;
4) Schedule VIA - Schedule of Funds Held by Ceding Reinsurers - has been updated based on industry feedback to clarify the reporting requirements and number of entry cells;

## Additional Guidance

i) "Information Sheet" tab paragraph (e) Filing Period - ensure that the filing period start date has been completed and is correct. Note that this will affect the transition rate for the BSCR calculation;

ii) "Information Sheet" tab paragraph (g) Multiplier Exchange/Translation Rate to Bermuda Dollars - ensure that the exchange rate has been completed. Note for insurers that report in currencies other than the Bermuda Dollar or United States Dollar, that the exchange rate to report is the rate to convert the figures to Bermuda Dollar / United States Dollar. For insurers reporting in Bermuda Dollar or United States Dollar, enter 1.000.

For example, if an insurer reported in Canadian Dollars with an exchange rate of CAD to BDA of 0.7657 and BDA to CAD of 1.3060 .

the exchange rate to report in paragraph (g) would be 0.7657
iii) "Information Sheet" tab paragraph (m)(iv) - the Authority would like to advise that in relation to paragraph (m)(iv) a qualified opinion would not include qualifications for reporting its financial statements as condensed general purpose financial statements.
