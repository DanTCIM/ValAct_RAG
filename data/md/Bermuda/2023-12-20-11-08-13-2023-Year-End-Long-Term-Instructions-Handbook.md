## A.OVERVIEW

## A1. INTRODUCTION TO THE CAPITAL AND SOLVENCY RETURN

A1.1 The capital and solvency return is an annual return relating to an insurer's risk management practices and information used by an insurer to calculate its Enhanced Capital Requirement (ECR) and Target Capital Level (TCL) as prescribed by Prudential Standard Rules (Rules) made under section 6A of the Insurance Act 1978 (Act). Every Class 4, Class 3B, Class 3A, Class E, Class D and Class C insurer, and Insurance Group shall submit to the Bermuda Monetary Authority (Authority or BMA) a completed capital and solvency return on or before its filing date. The most recent version of the capital and solvency return is available on the BMA website.

A1.2 The capital and solvency model is used to calculate an insurer's ECR, an additional capital and surplus requirement imposed by Rules made under section 6A of the Act. The ECR of an insurer shall be calculated at the end of its relevant year by the higher of the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR) model and an approved internal capital model, provided that the ECR amount is equal to or exceeds the Minimum Solvency Margin (MSM). The TCL of an insurer is calculated as $120 \%$ of the ECR and although not a capital requirement per se, insurers are expected to hold eligible capital resources to cover it; failure to do so will result in additional reporting requirements and enhanced monitoring, and in the submission of a remediation plan to restore capital above the TCL.

A1.3 The BSCR model calculates a risk-based capital measure by applying capital factors to capital and solvency return elements, including investments and other assets, operational risk, and Long-Term insurance risks, in order to establish an overall measure of capital and surplus for statutory solvency purposes. The capital factor established for each risk element, when applied to that element, produces a required capital and surplus amount. The individual capital amounts generated for each risk element (excluding operational risk) are then summed. Covariance adjustments are made to arrive at the BSCR (after covariance adjustment), which is further adjusted to include insurer-specific operational risk and capital add-ons, as assessed by the BMA, to finally produce the BSCR of an insurer.

A1.4 An insurer's available statutory capital and surplus divided by the BSCR gives the BSCR ratio. An insurer's available statutory capital and surplus divided by the ECR gives the ECR ratio. The BSCR and ECR ratios will assist the BMA to evaluate the financial strength of an insurer.

A1.5 The BSCR, ECR and TCL establish solvency capital levels that are used by the BMA to monitor the capital adequacy of Class 4, Class 3B, Class 3A, Class E, Class D and Class C insurers and Insurance Groups.

A1.6 When completing the BSCR model, the insurer should be advised of the following:

## Purpose

A1.7 This document presents clear instructions for persons responsible for computing the required capital and surplus and for submitting the completed capital and solvency return, including the BSCR model, to the BMA.

A1.8 The capital and solvency return contains diverse risk elements of an insurer's operation and will likely require the participation of experienced individuals within the accounting, finance, and actuarial areas of the insurer. In order to ensure accurate completion, insurers are highly advised to refer to this instruction handbook.

## Overview

A1.9 Forms 1SFS, 2SFS and 8SFS and are published in the Insurance Accounts Rules 2016. The filing guidance relating to Form 4EBS (refer to Schedule XIV for format and guidance) and Schedules II, IIA, IVB, V, V(a), V(c), V(e), V(f), V(g), V(k), V(l), VI, VII, VIII, VIII(a), IX, XII, XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX, XX, XXI and operational risk is published in the Prudential Standard Rules. The electronic copy of Forms 1SFS, 2SFS, 8SFS and Form 4EBS, and Schedules II, IIA, IVB, V, V((a), V(c), V(e), V(f), V(g), V(k), V(l), VI, VII, VIII, VIII(a), IX, XII, XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX, XX, XXI, and operational risk are included in the capital and solvency return and have been appropriately linked to the BSCR model, where applicable

A1.10 Also included is an appendix containing a glossary of terms that is meant to clarify the meaning of any terms used within the capital and solvency return, as well as to provide guidance on reconciling totals.

## Changes to the BSCR Formula

A1.11 Periodically, changes to the BSCR formula may be necessary due to changes in the capital and solvency return, accounting requirements, and enhancements to the formula or to the capital factors. Any such changes will be communicated to insurers in a timely
fashion, in order to allow adequate time for insurers to collect any additional information that may be required.

## Work Papers and Supporting Documents

A1.12 Work papers and documents used to prepare the BSCR submission should be retained and kept available for examination and discussion with the BMA, should the need arise.

## Additional Guidance

Item (i)(g) Business and Performance - investment performance and material income and expenses

B3.i. $\quad$ For item (i)(g) Business and Performance, the insurer shall provide details of the investment performance for the reporting period only. Material income and expenses shall be for the reporting period only and include all activities of the insurer (underwriting, investment, etc.).

## Identification of regulatory capital requirements for Dual licence holders

B3.ii. If the insurer holds two commercial licences (Class 4, 3B, 3A, E, D or C), the ECR and MSM may be identified on a combined basis. If one of the licences is limited purpose insurer (Class 1, 2, 3, A, B or SPI), the insurer shall identify the regulatory capital requirements for the licences separately and include the explanation that the MSM for limited purpose insurer is added to the commercial ECR.

## B4. ASSETS QUALIFYING FOR RISK MITIGATING PURPOSES

## Background

B4.1 In order to promote good risk management and increase risk sensitivity, the scope of risk mitigation in the BSCR is extended by allowing insurers to explicitly take into account their hedging programmes within market risk calculations, subject to certain rules and restrictions.

B4.2 Credit for risk mitigating effect in the BSCR calculations is only allowed if the risk mitigation techniques fulfil a set of criteria set out in the next section.

## Instructions

B4.3 The calculation of the ECR will allow for the effects of risk mitigation techniques through a reduction in requirements commensurate with the extent of risk mitigation notwithstanding the provisions set in this section.

B4.4 The ECR calculation for market risk is made on the basis of the assets and liabilities existing at the reference date of the ECR calculation and through the use of scenario and factor-based approaches; this design setting excludes by definition allowance for the full effect of dynamic hedging programmes which can only be applied appropriately in a context where capital charges are being stochastically calculated.

B4.5 Internal capital models are allowed to be used in the context of the BSCR standard formula for the calculation of the variable annuity guarantees capital charge which, despite being part of the long term insurance risk module, is predominantly market risk driven; concomitantly in these cases insurers may take into full account the effect of their dynamic hedging programmes as long as they comply with the provisions set in paragraphs B4.6 and B4.9 below. In all other cases, the risk mitigating effect of dynamic hedging programmes will be subject to the provisions set in paragraphs B4.6-B4.8 and thus taken into account in a limited manner.

B4.6 When calculating the ECR, insurers shall only take into account risk-mitigation where all of the following qualitative criteria are met:

a) The contractual arrangements and transfer of risk are legally effective and enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions and there must be an effective transfer of risk to a third party;

b) The contractual arrangement ensures that the risk transfer is clearly defined;

c) The insurer has taken all appropriate steps to ensure the effectiveness of the arrangement and to address the risks related to that arrangement;

d) The insurer is able to monitor the effectiveness of the arrangement and the related risks on an ongoing basis;
e) The calculation of the ECR makes reasonable allowance for any basis risk effects due to changes in risk mitigation assumptions and relationships during a stress scenario and there is appropriate treatment of any corresponding risks embedded in the use of risk mitigation techniques (e.g. credit risk). These two effects should be separated;

f) Providers of risk mitigation should have adequate credit quality (demonstrable through either adequate rating, capitalisation or collateralisation levels) to guarantee with appropriate certainty that the insurer will receive the protection in the cases specified by the contracting parties;

g) The insurer has, in the event of a default, insolvency or bankruptcy of a counterparty or other credit event set out in the transaction documentation for the arrangement, a direct claim on that counterparty; and

h) There is no double counting of risk-mitigation effects in technical provisions and in the calculation of the ECR or within the calculation of the ECR.

B4.7 Only risk-mitigation techniques that are in force for at least the next 12 months and which meet the qualitative criteria set out in paragraph B4.6 shall be fully taken into account in the ECR. In all other cases, the effect of risk-mitigation techniques that are in force for a period shorter than 12 months and which meet the qualitative criteria set out in paragraph B4.6 shall be taken into account in the ECR in proportion to the length of time involved for the shorter of the full term of the risk exposure or the period that the riskmitigation technique is in force.

B4.8 Where contractual arrangements governing the risk-mitigation techniques will be in force for a period shorter than the next 12 months and the insurer intends to replace that riskmitigation technique at the time of its expiry with a similar arrangement, the riskmitigation technique shall be fully taken into account in the ECR provided all of the following qualitative criteria are met:

a) The insurer has a written policy on the replacement of that risk-mitigation technique;

b) The replacement of the risk-mitigation technique shall not take place more often than every month, except in duly justified circumstances which require prior approval from the Authority;

c) The replacement of the risk-mitigation technique is not conditional on any future event, which is outside of the control of the insurer. Where the replacement of the risk-mitigation technique is conditional on any future event, that is within the control of the insurer, then the conditions should be clearly documented in the written policy referred to in point (a);

d) The replacement of the risk-mitigation technique shall be realistic based on replacements undertaken previously by the insurer and consistent with its current business practice and business strategy;

e) The risk that the risk-mitigation technique cannot be replaced due to an absence of liquidity in the market is not material under different market conditions and
there is no material basis or operational risks compared to the risk mitigation effect;

f) The risk that the cost of replacing the risk-mitigation technique increases during the following 12 months is reflected in the ECR by deducting it from the value attributed to the risk-mitigation technique;

g) Any additional risk stemming from the risk mitigation arrangement (e.g. credit risk) is taken into account in the ECR; and

h) The hedge effectiveness and any related risks are monitored on an ongoing basis.

B4.9 In the cases of insurers using internal capital models in the context of the BSCR standard formula for the calculation of the variable annuity guarantees capital charge, where portfolio rebalancing is being performed, the risk-mitigation effect shall be fully taken into account in the ECR provided all of the following qualitative criteria are met:

a) The insurer has a written policy on portfolio rebalancing;

b) The portfolio rebalancing shall be realistic based on actions undertaken previously by the insurer and consistent with its current business practice and business strategy;

c) The risk that the portfolio rebalancing cannot be performed due to an absence of liquidity in the market is not material under different market conditions;

d) The risk that the cost of the portfolio rebalancing increases during the following 12 months is reflected in the ECR;

e) Any additional risk stemming from the portfolio rebalancing (e.g. credit risk) is taken into account in the ECR; and

f) The hedge effectiveness and any related risks are monitored on an ongoing basis.

## B5. MANAGEMENT ACTIONS

## Background

B5.1 With the introduction of new shock-based capital charge calculations for certain risks in the BSCR standard formula, the use of management actions will be allowed under certain conditions (as set out in the next section).

B5.2 Management actions are relevant for products where profits are shared with policyholders, for example participating or 'with-profits' products. This means that management actions, in the sense used here, are mainly relevant for long-term insurers only.

B5.3 For BSCR purposes, allowable management actions will be confined to actions reducing or increasing liabilities for Future bonuses or other Discretionary Benefits (FDB).

a) These include changes to profit sharing / bonuses / policyholder dividends / credited rates, but can also include actions such as changes in investment policy (e.g. the equity backing ratio) affecting FDB.

B5.4 Given that the effect of management actions is considered separately for each risk in the modular BSCR standard formula, there is a risk of double counting the credit for management actions when the individual capital charges are aggregated (through the correlation matrices). For this reason, a cap on the overall credit must be included.

B5.5 The natural cap for the credit for management actions is the total amount of (best-estimate liabilities held for) future discretionary benefits.

a) The most an insurer can do to reduce its discretionary liabilities is to reduce the profit sharing - policyholder dividends, credited rate - to zero (in all future scenarios), which corresponds to FDB going to zero.

## Instructions

B5.6 Management actions are confined to actions reducing or increasing liabilities for future bonuses or other discretionary benefits.

B5.7 Management actions must comply with all the requirements of paragraph 196 of the Guidance Notes for Commercial Insurers and Groups Statutory Reporting Regime (30th November 2016).

B5.8 Given the modular structure of the BSCR standard formula, management actions are to be considered in each applicable risk calculation separately.

B5.9 Management actions can be reflected in the shock-based components of the BSCR standard formula and in the variable annuity guarantees capital charges (when an internal capital model is used). Management actions shall not be taken into account in the factor-based
components of the BSCR standard formula. The exception the duration-based approach to interest rate risk, where management actions may be taken into account in calculating effective durations for liabilities.

B5.10 The shock-based components of the BSCR standard formula are based on the impact of instantaneous stresses (equity risk, interest rate and liquidity risk calculated under the alternative approach, and currency risk), and insurers shall not take credit for future management actions at the time the stress occurs (i.e. during the stress), due to the instantaneous nature of the stresses. Nevertheless, future management actions may be taken into account after the instantaneous shocks as a response to the shocks.

B5.11 If management actions are used, the insurer needs to ensure that the effects of specific management actions are not effectively counted multiple times when the different scenario components are aggregated into the total capital requirement.

## Loss-absorbing Capacity of Future Bonuses and Other Discretionary Benefits

B5.12 To prevent double-counting, the capital requirement for each risk should be calculated both gross and net of the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions. Therefore, the applicable capital charges will be calculated with (net of) and without (gross of) management actions. This will allow calculating the capital requirement with management actions (net BSCR) and without management actions (gross BSCR), by aggregating the respective (net, gross) component capital requirements using the applicable correlation matrices.

B5.13 The gross capital requirement for each applicable risk is obtained as the decrease in the Net Asset Value (NAV) as a result of the shock, where the change in liabilities is calculated by comparing the after-shock gross best estimate liabilities to the base case best estimate liabilities. The gross capital requirement cannot be less than zero.

B5.14 The net capital requirement for each applicable risk is obtained as the decrease in the NAV as a result of the shock, where the change in liabilities is calculated by comparing the after-shock net best estimate liabilities to the base case best estimate liabilities. The net capital requirement cannot be less than zero.

B5.15 The gross BSCR (post diversification) ( $B S C R^{\text {div }}$ ) is calculated by aggregating the gross capital requirements using the relevant correlation matrices.

B5.16 The net BSCR (post diversification) ( $n B S C R^{\text {div }}$ ) is calculated by aggregating the net capital requirements using the relevant correlation matrices.

B5.17 The adjustment to the ECR for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions is then

$$
A d j_{T P}=-\max \left(\min \left(B S C R^{d i v}-n B S C R^{d i v}, F D B\right), 0\right)
$$

Where FDB is the net present value of future bonuses or other discretionary benefits corresponding to the best estimate calculation. The FDB amount is used as a cap on the overall credit allowed for in the capital requirement calculation.

B5.18 The gross capital requirements per risk shall be calculated by keeping the future discretionary benefits unchanged at the best estimate (base scenario) level.

B5.19 The net capital requirements per risk shall be calculated by allowing the future discretionary benefits to change as a result of a shock.

B5.20 For those risks which are calculated using a factor-based approach, the net BSCR is defined to be equal to the gross BSCR (except for the duration-based approach to interest rate risk, if the durations are calculated by taking management actions into account).

B5.21 The procedure as described above requires calculating the relevant capital charges twice: with and without management actions. Typically, this would mean that the insurer needs to run two model runs per relevant capital charge. Nevertheless, as this may. in some cases significantly increase the workload and/or the time needed to produce the required numbers, a simplified way to calculate the 'gross' charges, as described below, may be used. This approach requires only one set of model runs (base scenario + 'net' runs).

a) Obtain the value of guaranteed ${ }^{1}$ benefits and future discretionary benefits, separately, in the base scenario ${ }^{2}$.

b) Calculate guaranteed benefits and future discretionary benefits, with management actions, in each applicable shock. This gives the net best estimate liabilities in the shock scenarios.

c) To derive the gross best estimate liabilities needed for the gross capital requirement calculations, add future discretionary benefits from the base scenario to the guaranteed benefits from the shock scenarios to obtain gross best estimate liabilities in the shock scenarios.[^0]

## Additional Guidance

B5.i. Regarding the restriction of management actions to those actions affecting liabilities for future discretionary benefits, it is noted that premium increases ${ }^{3}$ or expense reductions are out of the scope of allowed management actions.

B5.ii. With regards to paragraph B5.8, it is noted that management actions may be taken immediately after the (instantaneous) stress has happened (subject to reflecting in the modeling realistic time required to implement any management action). The stresses are assumed to happen 'overnight', and management actions can be taken immediately on 'day 1 ' afterwards.

B5.iii. Both increases and decreases in future discretionary benefits as a result of shocks should be modelled. In particular, the liability for future discretionary benefits may increase as a result of certain shocks: For example, in the interest rate up shock the effect of higher future (reinvestment) rates may exceed any negative time- 0 effect on the values of fixed-income assets, leading to more profit sharing.

## Guidance - BSCR Model

B5.iv. Where applicable, the risk charges per module in the BSCR model are calculated both with and without management actions. This concerns principally those market risks that are calculated using shocks.

B5.v. The Schedules feeding the relevant risk calculations contain input fields for entering after shock values for best estimate liabilities both with and without management actions.

B5.vi. If no management actions are assumed, or if management actions do not affect a particular line, the 'with' value should be set equal to the 'without' value (where the latter is to be always calculated).

B5.vii. The effect of management actions on the ECR is calculated by comparing the 'Gross BSCR' to the 'Net BSCR', where the former is derived by aggregating individual risk charges without management actions, and the latter is derived by aggregating individual risk charges with management actions (using the[^1]relevant correlation matrices). This is completed on the Summary tab of the BSCR model.

B5.viii. Nevertheless, to avoid double- counting the same management actions in multiple separate risk modules, a cap on the overall credit for management actions needs to be imposed. The cap is equal to the initial reserve for FDB, which needs to be entered in cell N132 on the Summary tab.

B5.ix. The overall adjustment for management actions, subject to the cap, is then automatically calculated in cell N133 of the Summary tab, and gets deducted from the final BSCR (in cell N76).

## B6. LOOK-THROUGH

## Background

B6.1 Previously look-through was allowed in the BSCR in concentration risk calculation. To more properly assess the risks of fund-type investments and similar assets (and liabilities) the look-through approach is extended to market risk calculated under a shock approach (equity, interest rate and currency risks). This means looking through funds to the underlying investments, and considering each of the underlying assets individually in appropriate risk calculation(s).

B6.2 A full look-through of underlying assets should be used as a default option. If this is not achievable, then a number of partial look-through options are to be considered. As set out in the next section, these options form the following ladder:

a) Full look-through;

b) Partial look-through based on target asset allocation;

c) Partial look-through based on investment limits; and

d) No look-through - capital charge for other equities/other assets used.

## Instructions

B6.3 In order to properly assess the risks inherent in collective investment vehicles, other investments packaged as funds, and other types of assets and liabilities (as defined below), each of the assets underlying them shall be considered individually (the lookthrough approach) in the BSCR calculation.

B6.4 The scope of the look-through covers the following:

a) Collective investment vehicles and other investments packaged as funds, including related undertakings used as investment vehicles;

b) Segregated accounts assets and liabilities;

c) Deposit assets and liabilities;

d) Other sundry assets and liabilities; and

e) Derivatives.

B6.5 The look-through approach applies to market risk calculated under a shock approach (equity, interest rate and currency risks) and concentration risk calculations. It also applies to fund-type investments (as defined in B6.4a) within other risk calculations; for example, bond funds in fixed-income risk calculation.

a) Look-through will be allowed for equity exposures classified as 'strategic holdings' or 'duration based' with underlying individual assets getting the 20\% (strategic holdings, duration based) equity charge each.

B6.6 The look-through is to be based on the current underlying assets as of the BSCR valuation date (typically year-end). The valuation of assets and liabilities subject to application of the look through must be consistent with the EBS rules.

B6.7 Where the full look-through approach cannot be applied to collective investment vehicles or other investments packaged as funds, the capital requirement may be calculated based on the target underlying asset allocation of the vehicle or fund, provided that such a target allocation is available at a level of granularity necessary for the calculation, and the underlying assets are managed strictly according to the target allocation.

B6.8 Where conditions of paragraph B6.7 are not fulfilled (i.e., a target allocation does not exist, or it cannot be determined and the assets are managed strictly according to the target allocation), the capital requirement may be calculated by assuming that the vehicle or fund first invests to the maximum extent allowed under its investment limits in the asset class with the highest capital charge. It can then continue to make investments in descending order until the maximum total investment level is reached. This approach requires that such allocation limits exist.

B6.9 Where no look-through is possible and neither the target-based approach of paragraph B6.7 nor the limit-based approach of paragraph B6.8 can be applied, the whole investment shall be treated as an equity holding of type 'Other' for capital charge purposes.

B6.10 Insurers should perform a sufficient number of iterations of the look-through approach, where appropriate (e.g., in the case of fund of funds), to capture all material risk adequately.

## Additional Guidance

B6.i. To illustrate the application of the limit-based approach of paragraph B6.8, consider the following hypothetical example: For a combination fund having allocation limits of $50-80 \%$ to equity and $20-50 \%$ to investment grade fixed income, with equity sub-limits of 50-100\% to European Economic Area (EEA) equities and $0-50 \%$ to Eastern European (non-EEA) equities, the overall allocation would be considered to be $40 \%$ to non-EEA equities, $40 \%$ to EEA equities, and $20 \%$ to fixed income with rating BBB- to produce the most conservative capital charge consistent with the limits.

B6.ii. Exactly as is for directly held investments, instruments resulting from lookthrough may need to be considered in several risk calculations if the instruments' price is exposed to several sources of risk. For example, convertible bonds are typically exposed to interest rate, credit (spread) and equity risk, and would typically need to be included under all three risk calculations (i.e., interest rate, fixed income, and equity).

B6.iii. As set out in B6.4, related undertakings used as investment vehicles must be looked through and the assets underlying them must be considered individually. In particular, there is no economic difference in the risk of positions held directly on the balance sheet versus holding the same assets in a separate investment company instead. Therefore, the treatment and resulting capital charges should be the same in both cases.

B6.iv. In the case of long-short funds or leveraged funds, shocks (capital charges) cannot simply be applied to the NAV of the fund; instead, the increased exposure caused by leverage must be taken into account.

a) In the case of leveraged funds, where the leverage is implemented (e.g., by borrowing (instead of short sales)), the capital charge/shock needs to be applied to the gross exposure; and

b) In the case of long-short funds, only short positions that qualify as riskmitigating under the BSCR rules can be 'netted' against long positions (as described below). Consider the two extremes (i.e., all shorts qualifying versus none qualifying). If none of the short positions qualify as risk mitigating, only the long positions are shocked (and the short positions ignored); whereas if all of the short positions qualify as risk mitigating, both the long and the short positions are shocked (separately) and the resulting changes in values summed, so that the short positions provide an offset to the longs. In the former case, the gross long exposure is considered, while in the latter case the calculation is effectively on a net basis (however, the longs and shorts are shocked separately and then added, instead of shocking the net position). If part of the short positions qualify (and part do not), then only the qualifying short positions are shocked and, therefore, provide some offset to the longs, in addition to shocking all of the long positions.

## Guidance - BSCR Model

B6.v. When filling in Schedules feeding various risk calculations, the line items and the associated market values entered should already be after look-through. That is, the look-through of investments (necessarily) needs to be done outside the BSCR model, and the resulting numbers entered in the Schedules.

B6.vi. If investments are looked-through, the amounts shown in different risk calculations do not match the balance sheet classifications any more.

a) As a simple example, consider a mixed mutual fund with a market value of $\$ 100$, consisting of $60 \%$ equities and $40 \%$ corporate bonds. Assume it is originally classified under equity in the balance sheet (line 2.(c)iii.) and is the only investment. After the look-through, \$40 would be entered in Schedule IIB (EBS) under corporate bonds and \$60 under listed equity securities in developed markets. This means that the balance sheet shows equity investments of $\$ 100$, but in the equity risk calculation
the amount of equities is only $\$ 60$, corresponding to the true exposure after the lookthrough. Similarly, the balance sheet does not show fixed income exposure, but the fixed income risk calculation has bonds worth $\$ 40$ resulting from the look-through.

B6.vii. An 'Investment Reconciliation' tab is included in the BSCR model to do a reconciliation between the balance sheet (Form 4EBS) amounts and the amounts in Schedules IIB-IIF feeding the risk calculations on the one hand; and reconciliation between Schedules IIB-IIF and the risk calculations (equity, interest rate risk) on the other hand.

B6.viii. To illustrate the investment reconciliation tab, consider the example of paragraph B6.vi.

a) The opening balance on line 1 of the schedule (line 10 in the spreadsheet) would show the values from the balance sheet: $\$ 0$ in interest-rate sensitive investments (cell G10), and \$100 in equity sensitive investments (cell H10).

b) The adjustments for look-through could be done in either of two ways:

a) Entering the net adjustment directly. This would involve subtracting exposure of $\$ 40$ from equity (i.e., entering - $\$ 40$ to cell $\mathrm{H} 13$ ) and adding the $\$ 40$ to bonds (i.e., entering $\$ 40$ to cell G12).

b) Entering full amounts. Under this alternative, first indicate under which category the investment being looked-through was classified in the balance sheet. In the case of the example, the whole $\$ 100$ fund investment was under equity in the balance sheet; hence $\$ 100$ would be entered in cell F13 (balance sheet amounts reported under equities). Nevertheless, after looking through, the actual equity exposure was only $\$ 60$; this amount would be entered into cell H13. The remaining $\$ 40$, corresponding to bonds, would be entered into cell G12. Entering the original balance sheet amounts under columns E and F makes the reconciliation formula remove these amounts from the opening exposure, and then add the actual values resulting from the look-through back. In this example, the $\$ 100$ reported originally under equity in balance sheet is first removed from equity. Then only the actual equity exposure resulting from look-through (\$60) is added back to equity.

c) In either case, the final balances on line 18 of the schedule (line 27 of the spreadsheet) will show $\$ 40$ of interest-rate sensitive investments (in column $\mathrm{G}$ ) and $\$ 60$ of equity-sensitive investments (in column $\mathrm{H}$ ). These should match the amounts reported in Schedule IIB in the Schedule's fixed income and equity parts.

(g) The insurer verifies that the fund manager regularly interacts with the management teams of the companies in which the fund invests.

2) Direct investments: the following requirements should be met:

(a) The insurer computes the beta whenever BSCR is calculated.

(iv) Similarity criterion

1) The approach can only be applied to portfolios where any equity investment does not represent more than $10 \%$ of the portfolio value.
2) The approach cannot be applied to financial companies.
3) The beta of the unlisted equity portfolio is determined via the following steps:

(a) The hypothetical beta for each individual unlisted equity investment is calculated using the function set out below.

(b) The portfolio beta is calculated as the average of the individual betas weighted by the book values of the equity investments.

4) The beta for direct unlisted equity investments is calculated in the same way as the beta for individual portfolio companies above.
5) The similarity criterion is met if the beta of the portfolio or direct investment does not exceed a cut-off value of 0.80 .
6) The beta for an individual unlisted equity investment is calculated with the following formula: beta $=0.9478-0.34 \% * A v g G r o s s M a r g i n+$ 0.0139*TotalDebt/AvgCFO - 0.15\%*AvgROE; where AvgGrossMargin = Average Gross Margin, TotalDebt $=$ Total Debt, AvgCFO = Average Cash Flow from Operations, AvgRoe = Average Return on Common Equity. All the numbers should be entered as percentages/decimals multiplied by 100 (e.g., an ROE figure of $15.5 \%$ (i.e., 0.155 in decimal form)) would be entered as ' 15.5 ' in the formula and
7) In the above formula, 'Avg' means the average of the annual figures over the last five financial years. If this information is unavailable, the value at the end of the last financial year must be used.

The value of unlisted equity investments to which the lower capital charge is applied shall not exceed $5 \%$ of the market value of all investments.

B7.5 Ring-fenced shall be defined as assets and liabilities that:

a) Are managed and organised separately from other long-term businesses of the long-term insurer;
b) Are recorded as a separate (internal) financial reporting segment within the long-term insurer's general account; and

c) Have sufficient general account capital allocated to satisfy BSCR requirements on a stand-alone basis.

B7.6 Selected mutual funds - is defined as units or shares of alternative investment funds authorised as European Long-Term Investment Funds in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2015/760 of 29 April 2015, or units or shares of collective investment undertakings which are qualifying social entrepreneurship funds in accordance with article 3(b) of Regulation (EU) 346/2013 of 17 April 2013 or units or shares of collective investment undertakings which are qualifying venture capital funds as referred to in Article 3(b) of Regulation (EU) 345/2013 of 17 April 2013, and units or shares of closed-ended and unleveraged alternative investment funds where those alternative investment funds are established in the European Union or, if they are not established in the European Union, they are marketed in the European Union according to Articles 35 or 40 of Directive 2011/61/EU of 8 June 2011, as well as other similarly purposed investment funds approved by the Authority.

B7.7 Strategic holdings - A qualifying strategic holding must fulfil all of the following criteria:

a) The investing company holds at least $20 \%$ of voting rights or share capital in the investment or is able to demonstrate it has significant influence (as defined by the applicable GAAP) over the investment;

b) The value of the equity investment is likely to be materially less volatile than the value of other equities as a result of both the nature of the investment and the influence exercised by the participating company; and

c) The nature of the investment is strategic, taking into account:

(i) The existence of a clear decisive strategy to continue holding participation for a long period;

(ii) The consistency of such strategy with the main policies guiding or limiting the actions of the participating company; and where the company is part of a group, the consistency of such strategy with the main policies guiding or limiting the actions of the group;

## C.STATUTORY STATEMENTS AND BSCR SCHEDULES

## C1. FORMS 1SFS, 2SFS, 8SFS AND FORM 4EBS

## Background

C1.1 The statutory balance sheet (Form 1SFS), statutory statement of income (Form 2SFS), and statutory statement of capital and surplus (Form 8SFS) shall be completed by the insurer in accordance with the filing guidance relating to these Forms found in the Insurance Accounts Rules 2016.

C1.2 Additionally, the insurer must ensure that amounts reported in these forms correspond to the general purpose financial statements (condensed general purpose financial statements for Class 3A, Class C and Class D insurers) less prudential filters such as prepaid expenses, intangible assets, and goodwill, where appropriate.

C1.3 For insurers that have no change in valuations from an unconsolidated and consolidated basis, the insurer is to provide details in the consolidated column only and a note in the submission tab indicating there is no valuation differences between the unconsolidated and consolidated basis.

C1.4 The Economic Balance Sheet (Form 4EBS) shall be completed by the insurer in accordance with the filing guidance relating to this Form found in the Prudential Standard Rules.

## Additional Guidance

## Figures are to be reported in thousand units (' $000 \mathrm{~s}$ )

C1.i. Although the insurer does not need to prepare its financial statements in thousands units, the Authority requires insurers to report its statutory financial statements and economic balance sheet in thousands as this impacts the capital charges calculated in the BSCR model. The insurer may attach its Statutory Financial Return under 'Other Attachments' to provide the BMA with a more accurate financial position.

## Future operating lease payments

C1.ii. For the 2019 year-end and beyond, insurers that have future operating lease payments are to gross up their balance sheet for the right of use assets and a lease liability equivalent to the discounted value of future payments under an operating lease only if the underlying assets being leased are tangible assets.

Further in the Schedule V(e) stress test scenarios, lease liability should be included in the following scenarios:

- Interest Rate Stress Scenario;
- Expected Inflation Stress Scenario;
- Foreign Exchange stress (where relevant);

Insurers are to report the right of use assets on Form 1SFS and 1EBS as 'Other Sundry Assets' and on Schedule IIF 'Other Sundry Assets and Liabilities' on Line 28 'Other Equities / Other Assets.'

## Technical Provision calculation - Risk Margin calculation

C1.iii. For reporting periods where the financial year-end falls within the BSCR transitional period, insurers are to determine the risk margin using projected future BSCRs that take into account the run-off of the transitional rules. That is, the risk margin should be determined by projecting both the old-basis BSCRs and the new-basis BSCRs into future, and applying the appropriate transitional weights at each future year-end within the projection to calculate the future transitional BSCRs that are then used in the Risk Margin calculation. After the transitional period ends in the projection, the new-basis BSCRs are to be used.

## C2. SCHEDULE OF FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS BY BSCR RATING (SCHEDULE II)

## Background

C2.1 The schedule of fixed income and equity investments by BSCR rating (Schedule II), provides a breakdown of an insurer's bonds and debentures and equity investments by both investment categories (Corporate \& Sovereign Bonds, Residential MortgageBacked Securities, Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities/Asset-Backed Securities and Bond Mutual Funds) and BSCR Ratings (Ratings 0-8).

C2.2 This schedule applies a capital charge based on the type of category and rating of the security held, which is aggregated in the fixed income and equity risk tab. Further this information provides the BMA with the type and quality of investments held for assessing the insurer's market risk. It is noted that the balances reported on this schedule also serves as a proxy of the insurer's liquidity position when assessed with the Schedule of Funds Held by Ceding Reinsurers in Segregated Accounts / Trusts by BSCR Rating (Schedule IIA), and Interest Rate/Liquidly Risk Charge.

## Items

C2.3 The Schedule is broken into three separate sections for which the total of each should correspond to a specific balance reported in Form 4EBS and Unconsolidated Form 1SFS for the relevant year:

a) Quoted and unquoted bonds and debentures - Line 10, Column (9) 'Total" corresponds to Form 4EBS and Unconsolidated Form 1SFS, Line 2(b) and 3(b);

b) Quoted and unquoted equities - Line 21, Column (9) 'Total' corresponds to Form 4EBS and Unconsolidated Form 1SFS, Line 2(d) and 3(d); and

c) Mortgage loans - Line 26, Column (1) 'Total' corresponds to Form 4EBS and Unconsolidated Form 1SFS, Line 5(c).

## Instructions Affecting Schedule II

C2.3a Fixed income investments, both quoted and unquoted, shall be categorised into corporate bonds and sovereign bonds, residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities/asset-backed securities, and bond mutual funds and classified by BSCR rating;

C2.3b Equity investments, both quoted and unquoted, shall be categorised into common stock, preferred stock and equity mutual funds;

C2.3c Preferred stock shall be classified by BSCR rating;

C2.3d Sovereign debt issued by a country in its own currency that is rated AA- or better shall be classified under BSCR rating 0 while all other sovereign bonds shall be classified in a similar manner as corporate bonds;

C2.3e Debt issued by government-owned and related entities that were explicitly guaranteed by that government, with the exception of mortgage-backed securities, shall be assigned a BSCR rating of 0 , provided that the country is rated AA- or better and the debt is in the local currency of the country and otherwise classified in a similar manner as corporate bonds;

C2.3f Bond mutual funds shall be classified based on the underlying bond ratings as advised by the fund manager; equity mutual funds shall be classified in a similar manner as direct equity investments;

C2.3g Money market funds shall be classified by the underlying credit security based on the BSCR rating prescribed in Schedule XIX; and

C2.3h Amounts are to be reported on both an unconsolidated and consolidated EBS basis.

## BSCR Ratings

C2.3i The following process will apply to determine the BSCR rating classifications:

a) Use the lowest BSCR rating comparable to the ratings of S\&P, Moody's, Fitch and AM Best.

b) Insurers may select additional BMA named rating agencies to use, from those included in the table in the next paragraph, subject to the following:

(i) The additional BMA named rating agencies are Dominion Bond Rating Service, Egan Jones Rating Company, Japan Credit Rating Agency and Kroll Bond Rating Agency;

(ii) Insurers must document the selection process of credit rating agencies;

(iii) Insurers must use the selected rating agencies and their ratings in a consistent manner over time. There must be a documented process for making any changes to the list of selected rating agencies and how ratings are selected;

(iv) The selection process and its outcome must be approved by senior management; and

(v) The lowest BSCR rating comparable to the ratings of all the selected rating agencies, including the rating agencies from step (a), is used.
c) For any fixed income instruments for which a credit rating is not available from any of the rating agencies named in step (a) or step (b) (as per the insurer's selection), the insurer may elect to either leave the assets as unrated (i.e. BSCR rating 8) or obtain the BSCR rating from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Securities Valuation Office (SVO) rating.

C2.3j The table below contains, for each credit rating agency, the rating categories for which their ratings are allowed for BSCR purposes (marked with ' $X$ '). Additionally, the NAIC SVO ratings may be applied for otherwise unrated assets in accordance with the previous paragraph.

| Credit Rating <br> Agency | Principal <br> Office | Financial <br> institutions, <br> brokers and <br> dealers | Insurance <br> companies | Corporate <br> issuers | Issuers of <br> asset-backed <br> securities | Government <br> securities, municipal <br> securities, foreign <br> government <br> securities |

C2.31 A BSCR rating of 0 (not included above) has been provided for certain high-quality fixedincome investments, specifically sovereign bonds and bond mutual funds.

## Additional Guidance

## Figures are to be reported in thousand units (' $000 \mathrm{~s}$ )

C2.ii. Although the insurer does not need to prepare its financial statements in thousands units, the Authority requires insurers to report its statutory financial statements and economic balance sheet in thousands as this impacts the capital charges calculated in the BSCR model. The insurer may attach its Statutory Financial Return under "Other Attachments" to provide the BMA with a more accurate financial position

## Applying a BSCR Rating to unquoted internally rated investments

C2.iii. Insurers that have developed an internal rating for unquoted investments shall apply a BSCR rating of 8 . Nevertheless, if an insurer would like to request permission to use an equivalent scale of these investments in their BSCR filing, the insurer shall request such permission in writing to the BMA and include details on the internal rating assessment and a proposed equivalent scale to the BSCR Rating scale. Only upon approval shall the insurer reclassify an unquoted investment from BSCR Rating 8.

Government National Mortgage Association, Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation are not eligible for BSCR Rating 0

C2.iv. Securities that have a BSCR Rating 0 have been defined as 'Sovereign debt issued by a country in its own currency that is rated AA- or better', however the Authority would like to acknowledge that GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC are not eligible for the sovereign bond classification BSCR Rating 0 and shall be reported under MBS. While the Authority acknowledges that an explicit government guarantee applies to the credit risk for GNMA-insured mortgages uncertainty remains with the timing of the mortgage loan repayments. Consequently, the Authority does not extend the sovereign debt treatment to MBS.

## MBS to use NAIC Rating

C2.v. MBS do not always adequately reflect the risk associated with being held at less than par value. For this reason, the NAIC has modeled these bonds and provides United States insurers with a rating reclassification. The Authority shall allow insurers the option to use these reclassifications when summarising their portfolio. Instances where an instrument has a rating from a rating agency that would put it in BSCR ratings classes 1-2, and it has also been classified as NAIC ratings class 1 (equivalent to BSCR ratings class 3), then the better BSCR ratings class may be selected. The Authority requires insurers to provide a separate summary of the Form 1SFS value by BSCR rating class, both before and after the adjustment.

The NAIC reclassifications of MBS will be assigned to the BSCR Ratings classes according to the following table:

| BSCR Rating Class | NAIC <br> (for MBS Only) |
| :---: | :---: |
| 0 |  |
| 1 |  |
| 2 | 1 |
| 3 | 2 |
| 4 | 3 |
| 5 | 4 |
| 7 | 5 |
| 8 | 6 |

Some Residential MBS bonds are not directly modelled by the NAIC, including bonds held by insurers that do not have a U.S. presence. The NAIC provides a documented four-step process as part of its SSAP No. 43R for reclassifying such bonds based on their rating and their Form 1SFS value relative to par. The Authority shall allow companies to optionally follow this process in classifying bonds that the NAIC has not formally reclassified.

## C3. SCHEDULE OF FUNDS HELD BY CEDING REINSURERS IN SEGREGATED ACCOUNTS/TRUSTS BY BSCR RATING (SCHEDULE IIA)

## Background

C3.1 To assess the risk of amounts reported in Funds Held By Ceding Reinsurers (Form 4EBS, Line 12(c)), the Authority requires insurers to determine the arrangement that the funds are being held. In the event of default, if the reinsurer bears the risk of the assets held, then these amounts are to be reported on Schedule XVIII - Schedule of Particulars of Ceded Reinsurance; if the insurer bears the risk (as well as the market risk of the valuation of investments), then these amounts are to be reported in Schedule IIA Schedule of Funds Held by Ceding Reinsurers in Segregated Accounts/Trusts By BSCR Rating.

C3.2 The Schedule of Funds Held by Ceding Reinsurers in Segregated Accounts/Trusts by BSCR Rating - Schedule IIA - provides the BMA with details to assess the type and quality of investment held by requiring the insurer to allocate the balances by investment category and BSCR Rating (similar to investments reported on Schedule II). Further the balances reported on Schedule IIA also are used in the calculation for the Interest Rate/Liquidity Risk and Cash and Cash Equivalents exposure.

C3.3 The investment categorisation and BSCR ratings shall be based on the same rating scale and principles as those found in Schedule II.

## Items

C3.4 The Schedule is broken into five separate sections as follows:

a. Quoted and unquoted bonds and debentures;

b. Quoted and unquoted equities;

c. Other investment;

d. Mortgage loans; and

e. Cash and time deposits.

## Instructions Affecting Schedule IIA

C3.5 All funds held by ceding reinsurers (as reflected in Form 4EBS, Line 12(c) and Form 1SFS, Line 12) in segregated accounts/trusts with identifiable assets, such as fixed income investments, equity investments, mortgage loans, other investments and cash and cash equivalents, shall be included here;

C3.6 Fixed income investments, both quoted and unquoted, shall be categorised into corporate bonds and sovereign bonds, residential MBS, commercial MBS/asset-backed securities, and bond mutual funds and classified by BSCR rating;

C3.7 Equity investments, both quoted and unquoted, shall be categorised into common stock, preferred stock and equity mutual funds;

C3.8 Preferred stock shall be classified by BSCR rating;

C3.9 BSCR ratings shall be determined in the manner specified in the instructions affecting Schedule II;

C3.10 Sovereign debt issued by a country in its own currency that is rated AA- or better shall be classified under BSCR rating 0 while all other sovereign bonds shall be classified in a similar manner as corporate bonds;

C3.11 Debt issued by government-owned and related entities that were explicitly guaranteed by that government, with the exception of MBS, shall be assigned a BSCR rating of 0 ;

C3.12 Bond mutual funds shall be classified based on the underlying bond ratings as advised by the fund manager; equity mutual funds shall be classified in a similar manner as direct equity investments;

C3.13 Money market funds shall be classified by the underlying credit security based on the BSCR rating prescribed in Schedule XIX; and

C3.14 Amounts are to be reported both on an unconsolidated and consolidated EBS basis.

## Additional Guidance

## Additional guidance for assessing the Funds Held By Ceding Reinsurer arrangement

C3.i. For funds held by ceding companies, the capital risk charge is calculated by the nature of the arrangement.

a) Where specific assets have been allocated for the benefit of the reinsurer, such that the reinsurer bears market risk on those assets, the Authority requires insurers to look through to the underlying assets, and report these balances on Schedule IIA. This effectively adds to the fixed-income risk and equity risk modules similar to Schedule II.

b) Where there are no specific identified assets, the reinsurer is effectively in a similar position to a typical cedant with reinsurer exposure, and the amounts will thus be treated similarly to reinsurance recoveries and shall be reported on Schedule XVIII Particulars of Ceded Reinsurers. Further, the rating for reinsurance exposures should be based on the financial strength ratings of the insurer.

## Applying a BSCR Rating to unquoted internally rated investments

C3.ii. Insurers that have developed an internal rating for unquoted investments shall apply a BSCR rating of 8 . Nevertheless if an insurer would like to request permission to use an equivalent scale of these investments in their BSCR filing, the insurer shall request such permission in writing to the BMA and include details on the internal rating assessment and a proposed equivalent scale to the BSCR Rating scale. Only upon approval shall the insurer reclassify an unquoted investment from BSCR Rating 8. For funds held by ceding companies, the capital risk charge is calculated by the nature of the arrangement.

## Reporting hedge funds

C3.iii. When reporting hedge funds on Schedule II, insurers may not have the exact details of the underlying assets in which the funds are held. In these instances, the Authority advises allocating on a proportionate basis of the balance of the portfolio to the approved investment guidelines of the hedge fund and provide in the Attachment section the methodology used when reporting these figures.

## C4. SCHEDULE OF LONG-TERM BUSINESS PREMIUMS (SCHEDULE IVB)

## Background

C4.1 The schedule of Long-Term Business Premiums - Schedule IVB — provides a breakdown of an insurer's gross premiums and other considerations, and net premiums and other considerations by prescribed long-term insurance product. Insurers are required to separate the long-term gross premiums written into 'unrelated' and 'related' business according to statutory long-term insurance products.

C4.2 A description of these insurance products is listed below:

|  | Long-Term Business <br> Lines of Business | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Mortality | The risk of fluctuations or deterioration of mortality experience <br> causing increased claims on life insurance coverages. |
| 2 | Critical illness | A form of accident and health insurance that pays a benefit if the <br> person insured incurs a predefined major illness or injury. |
| 3 | Longevity | The risk of fluctuations or improvements in mortality that cause <br> benefits on payout annuities to be paid for longer than expected. |
| 4 | Deferred annuities | An insurance that provides savings or income benefits during the <br> lifetime of the person insured or some limited period thereafter. |
| 5 | Disability income: active <br> lives with premium <br> guarantee of - | An accident and health insurance that pays a benefit for a fixed <br> period of time during disability, based on contracts that are for <br> active lives and have a premium guarantee. |
| 6 | Disability income: active <br> lives for other accident <br> and sickness | An accident and health insurance that pays a benefit for a fixed <br> period of time during disability based on contracts that are for <br> active lives and are for other accident and sickness coverage. |
| 7 | Disability income: <br> claims in payment | An accident and health insurance that pays a benefit for a fixed <br> period of time during disability based on contracts where claims <br> in payment are issued on waiver of premiums. |
| 8 | Disability income: <br> claims in payment for <br> other accident and <br> sickness | An accident and health insurance that pays a benefit for a fixed <br> period of time during disability based on contracts where claims <br> in payment on waiver of premiums are based on contracts that <br> are for active lives and are for other accident and sickness <br> coverage. |
| 10 | Group life <br> arrangement such as through an employer or association. |  |
| Group disability <br> Group health <br> group arrangement such as through an employer or association. |  |  |
| Health insurance that is issued to persons insured through a <br> group arrangement such as through an employer or association. |  |  |
| 11 |  |  |


| 12 | Stop loss | The risk that arises when total claims experience deteriorates or <br> is more volatile than expected, thereby increasing the likelihood <br> and amount by which actual claims experience exceeds a <br> predefined level. |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 13 | Rider | The risk that arises when total claims experience deteriorates or <br> is more volatile than expected, thereby increasing the likelihood <br> and amount by which actual claims experience exceeds a <br> predefined level. |
| 14 | Variable annuities | Insurance that provides a minimum investment guarantee on <br> variable annuities. |

C4.3 Line item 15 'Total' of Schedule IVB for total gross premiums and other considerations, and net premiums and other consideration should correspond to the balance reported in Form 2SFS, lines 12(c) and 14(d), respectively, for the relevant year.

## Additional Guidance

## Figures are to be reported in thousand units (' $000 \mathrm{~s}$ )

C4.i. Although the insurer does not need to prepare its financial statements in thousands units, the Authority requires insurers to report its statutory financial statements and economic balance sheet in thousands as this impacts the capital charges calculated in the BSCR model. The insurer may attach its Statutory Financial Return under 'Other Attachments' to provide the BMA with a more accurate financial position.

## Reporting premiums as unrelated or related

C4.ii. When reporting the gross premiums as 'unrelated' or 'related', the Authority advises the following:

a) Schedule of Long-Term Premiums Unconsolidated - the insurer should look at the nature of the contract and not 'look though' the underlying risk. If the insurer writes to an affiliate, then the insurer should include this as related business, if the business is not connected to any affiliate within the insurance group, then this shall be reported as unrelated.

b) Schedule of Long-Term Premiums Consolidated - the insurer should 'look through' to the underlying policyholder and determine the appropriate categorisation based on its relationship with the underlying policyholder. If the insurer writes to an affiliate (or any affiliate within the insurance group), then the insurer shall look through the underlying risk and if it is to third party, then this shall be included as unrelated business. Otherwise this is included as related risk.

## C5. SCHEDULE OF RISK EXPOSURE (SCHEDULE IVF)

## Background

C5.1 The Schedule of Risk Exposure - Schedule IVF - requires all insurers to provide a breakdown of the:

a) Number of subsidiaries per location. For the purpose of this schedule, the BMA has identified 37 locations worldwide;

b) Long-Term business Gross Reserves by location for Mortality risk, Longevity risk, Deferred Accumulations Annuities, Disability, Group, Variable Annuities, and Other Products at year-end; and

c) Long-Term Claims and Benefit Paid by location for the financial period.

The information in this Schedule provides the BMA with details of the geographic location of long-term business reserves established for those risks and the related claims paid. Accordingly, this information enables the BMA to demonstrate the key role Bermuda plays in the supply and diversification of risk capacity globally

Items

C5.2 Provide jurisdiction of the ultimate parent company of the insurer:

C5.3 All insurance groups shall provide the following information for the reporting period

## Instructions Affecting Schedule IVF

C5.3a 'Location' shall be the location of the risk being underwritten. If the location of the risk being underwritten is not available, then insurers are to allocate based on the location of the cedant;

C5.3j All amounts shall be reported on a consolidated basis only.

## C6. SCHEDULE OF RISK MANAGEMENT (SCHEDULE V)

## Background

C6.1 For assessing the areas of risk of an insurer, the Authority also takes into consideration the insurer's risk management structure on an on-going basis. Such areas include: structure of the insurer, the underwriting risks, market/investment risks, liquidity/interest rate risk and any other risks (such as deposit assets and liabilities and segregated accounts) associated with the insurer. These areas are to be provided on a forwardlooking basis and if there are significant changes to the insurer's business plan for the upcoming year, the insurer shall include a description of the change in the supporting documentation.

C6.2 The schedule of risk management shall include the following:

a) Governance and group structure

## Additional Guidance

## Change in Board and/or senior management after financial year-end

C6.i. Instances where the composition of the board and senior management has undergone changes since the financial year-end, insurers are to report the composition of the board and senior managements as of the financial year-end, as well as provide in brackets in the name field, the effective date of the previous and new members of the board or senior management.

C6.ii. Note that under section 30J of the Act, a notification is required for change in board members and officers within 45 days of the insurer becoming aware of the change, and thus the inclusion of this information in the BSCR does not qualify as notification of such change.

## Terms of Reference clarification

C6.iii. 'Terms of Reference' in this case refers to the duties of the board and its subcommittees as stated in the company's charter. The BMA reviews the terms of reference in assessing whether significant decisions are deliberated in Bermuda, and if the insurer meets the head office requirements. If the insurer's bye-laws include information which aids in the BMA's assessment, it is then acceptable.

## Figures are to be reported in thousand units (' $000 \mathrm{~s})$

C6.iv. The figures for Schedule V(a), Items 10 and 11 are to be reported in thousand units ('000s) in the reporting currency used for the return. The insurer may attach additional information under 'Other Attachments' to provide the BMA with the financial position of the Group and/or the insurers in their local currency.

## Insurance Group Details If not part of an insurance group

C6.v. If the insurer is not part of an insurance group, the insurer shall put the values reported on Form 4EBS in Schedule V(a), item 10 'Group's Financial Position'.

## Insurance Group details of entities domiciled in Bermuda

C6.vi. The insurer is one of a few insurance companies within the group operating out of Bermuda. Does it still report the overall group position or combined amounts for the Bermuda-domiciled entities?

The insurer shall report for all companies within the group, regardless of place of incorporation. Therefore, it shall report the overall group position based on its most recent audited general purpose financial statements.

## Insurance Group details of with unaudited statements

C6.vii. The insurance group does not produce audited general purpose financial statements. Shall the insurer report NIL (0) values?

The Authority will accept the requested information based on unaudited group financial statements. The insurer should not leave this field blank.

## Insurance Group details - organisational chart

C6.viii. The insurer is part of a large insurance group with subsidiaries worldwide. Can the insurer submit a condensed organisational chart that includes only the Bermuda entities?

The Authority requires the organisational chart to include all group companies and indicate the place of incorporation and percentage holdings. Further the Bermuda insurer shall be clearly identifiable.

## Details of the services outsourced - scope of services

C6.ix. When responding to the details of the services outsourced, insurers should consider both internal and external parties when responding to this section.

C6.2b Intra-group transactions to which the insurer is a party and the insurer's risk concentrations-

a) Ten largest exposures to unaffiliated counterparties and any other unaffiliated counterparty exposures or series of linked unaffiliated counterparty exposures exceeding $10 \%$ of the insurer's statutory capital and surplus=

(iv)The proportion of the insurer's insurance business exposure covered by internal reinsurance, retrocession and other risk transfer arrangements;

## Additional Guidance

## Material intra group transactions, and intra-group reinsurance and retrocession arrangements

C6.x. When providing details of 'material intra-group transactions' the Authority considers 'material exposure' in relation to statutory capital and surplus (i.e., Greater than $10 \%$ of statutory capital and surplus), as well as the materiality of the specific disclosure. For example, if the insurer holds cash of $\$ 3$ million and total assets of $\$ 4$ million, the BMA would consider the $\$ 3$ million cash balance to be material as it pertains to $75 \%$ of the insurer's total assets.

When providing details of 'intra-group reinsurance and retrocession arrangements' the Authority is looking for all intra-group reinsurance and retrocession arrangements. Note that if an insurer having more than 25 transactions with the same assuming and ceding party, they can be aggregated together. If an insurer has more than 25 transactions, please include these details in the attachments section of the BSCR model.

The 'Aggregated Premium Flows' shall be the premium written for the reporting period (note that net refers to any reinsurance that is ceded back to the counterparty). The "Aggregated Values of the Exposure Limits" shall be the outstanding reserve at the reporting period (note the net refers to any reinsurance that is deducted from the counterparty).

In instances where the insurer is an affiliated reinsurer and all of its transactions are deemed intra-group transactions, the insurer may include an attachment that provides this information.

## Internal reinsurance arrangement calculation

C6.xi. The proportion of internal reinsurance arrangements is calculated by dividing the amount of reinsurance provided by affiliates into the total amount of reinsurance available. The insurer shall only include arrangements where it is the ceding party.

## Unaffiliated counterparties ten largest exposures

C6.xii. In instances where the insurer does not have any investing activities, yet it holds cash and cash equivalents, the insurer shall list these as counterparty exposures as well as include each bank separately.

## Unaffiliated counterparties ten largest exposures - investments to report

C6.xiii. When determining the ten largest unaffiliated counterparty exposures, insurers are to include cash \& cash equivalents, investments (as well as hedge funds) receivables, recoverables and letters of credit at the end of the reporting period. If the information is available, insurers are to provide a look-through basis of the underlying investment.

C6.2c The effective duration of assets must be determined using the aggregate of the total bonds and debentures (as reflected in Form 4EBS, lines 2(b) ad 3(b)), preferred stock (as reflected in Form 4EBS, lines 2(c)(ii) and 3(c)(ii)), and mortgage loans (as reflected in Form 4EBS, line $5(\mathrm{c})$ ) as a basis;

C6.2d The effective duration of liabilities must be determined using the reserves (as reflected in Form 4EBS, line 27(d)) as a basis;

C6.2e The weighted average of the difference in asset duration and liability duration is the weighted average of the difference in the effective asset dollar duration and effective liability dollar duration;

## Additional Guidance

## Mutual Fund information to provide

C6.xiv. Insurers to are to provide a summary report (in Excel format) that lists each fund the insurer is actually using, a brief description of the type of fund (such as bond fund, equity fund balanced fund, etc.) and the amount the insurer has invested in each fund.

a) The insurer's latest estimate of new business premiums written;

b) Estimated net income or loss either for the insurer or on a group basis with disclosure of the estimated percentage of the insurer's contribution relative to the group; and
c) A qualitative description of the insurer's business and underwriting strategy to be used in an attempt to achieve the estimates in (a) and (b) above (Required for Class $D$ and $E$ insurers only);

## Additional Guidance

## Qualitative description of the insurer's business strategy and underwriting strategy compared to summary of products features and risks

C6.xv. The requirements for providing 'details of the insurer's description of insurer's business strategy and underwriting risks' (item (j)) and 'summary of products features and risks’ (item (k)) appear similar, can the insurer submit one document to cover both requirements?

Item (j) is a qualitative description of the insurer's business and underwriting strategy to be used in an attempt to achieve the estimates for new business premiums written and net income or loss. It should describe the lines of business that will be written and the amounts. If the insurer estimates it will have a net loss, it should include a description of if/how it intends to have a net income in subsequent years. The BMA uses this information to form an opinion of trends in the market, the insurer's forward-looking risk profile, its ability to withstand stress scenarios, and developing peer groupings.

Item $(\mathrm{k})$ requires a summary of product features and risks that the insurer writes, both current and those that are no longer written but remain on the books. The summary must cover the primary product features and benefits insured and any policyholder options or guarantees that could materially affect the insurer. The BMA uses this information to form an opinion of trends in the market and developing peer groupings. The summary is also reviewed closely to identify areas where policyholders may not be protected, particularly when an insurer fails to meet its regulatory obligations.

Items (j) and (k) may be covered in one document provided the document includes the necessary information.

C6.2j Summary of product features and risks must cover the primary product features and benefits insured and any policyholder options or guarantees that could materially affect the insurer; (Required for Class D and E insurers only)

## Additional Guidance

## Contracts that qualify as Deposit Assets and Liabilities

C6.xvii. Deposit Asset and Liability contracts represent insurance contracts that do not meet the definition of meeting insurance risk (as applicable per the insurer's GAAP). Prior to 31 December, 2016, if an insurer wrote insurance business that did not meet the definition of insurance risk, insurers would be required to seek BMA approval to include such contracts in the statutory balance sheet. Going forward, this approval will not be necessary.

As a result, the Authority has provided the new schedule V(k) Details of Deposit Asset \& Liabilities to assess the insurer contracts that do not meet the definition of insurance risk, and lines of business that are written (both on a gross and net basis) for the reporting period, assess the assets that are supporting these obligations; and the exposure levels of such contracts.

## Details by contract and line of business

C6.xviii.Complete the schedule by providing the lines of business written for each exposure type separately. In other words, if an insurer has exposure that writes both property and casualty business), then the insurer is to report the business for the property business on one line and report the casualty business line separately.

C6.2q In respect of segregated account business, details of each by net loss reserves by statutory lines of business: segregated account cell name, total assets, total liabilities, statutory capital and surplus, cash and investments, net loss reserves, reinsurance recoverable, statutory lines of business written, gross premium written, net premium written, currency, details (if any) of the insurer writing "related" business, details if the insurance or reinsurance contract has limited recourse language, details of inter-relationship between segregated account cells (if any), details of the segregated account cell's access to the general account (if any) and details where a segregated account cell is in a deficit, insolvent or subject to litigation.

'Related' for the purposes of this paragraph, means where the insurance business written by a segregated account cell is business that meets the definition in the Act of business that can ordinarily be written by a Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, Class A or Class B insurance business (with the exception that the insurance business written is that which is assumed from an affiliate insurer; is deemed by the Authority as 'connected business'; or is business written by an insurer owned by insurance brokers or agents);

'Limited recourse' for the purposes of this paragraph, means where the segregated account cell has access to the general account in the instance the segregated account cell is in deficit;

'Inter-relationship between segregated account cells' for the purposes of this paragraph, means where the segregated account cell has access to another segregated account cell. (IE if one segregated account cell were to be in deficit, whether another segregated account cell could be able to support the deficit?

## Additional Guidance

C6.xix. Complete the schedule by providing the lines of business written for each cell separately. In other words if an insurer has exposure that writes both property and casualty business, then the insurer is to report the business for the property business on one line and report the casualty business line separately.

C6.2r Alternative Capital Schedule is applicable to insurers that conduct business that is financed by a mechanism other than shareholders' capital of the (re)insurance company. This may take various forms such as catastrophe (cat) bonds, industry loss warranties, sidecars, collateralized reinsurers, longevity and mortality bond/swaps, hybrid securities such as preference shares, swaps, and contingent capital such as letters of credit, among others

## C10. SCHEDULE OF LONG-TERM VARIABLE ANNUITY - INTERNAL CAPITAL MODEL (SCHEDULE VIIIA)

## Background

C10.1 The schedule of Long-Term Variable Annuity - Internal Capital Model - Schedule VIIIA - is intended to capture the internal model-based capital requirements for variable annuities.

C10.2 Insurers must obtain permission from the BMA to complete Schedule VIIIA in lieu of Schedule VIII.

C10.3 Once the insurer has selected to complete Schedule VIIIA, it would be unable to switch to completing Schedule VIII without first obtaining approval from the BMA.

## Items

C10.4 Disclosures on insurer's in-force data

For each type of variable annuity guarantee risk, insurers will be required to provide summaries of their policy data by policy accounts, account values, guarantee amounts, and net amounts at risk with their BSCR EBS Best Estimate amounts. Such data should be further broken out by policy year, the level of fund volatility $(0-10 \%, 10-20 \%, 20 \%+)$, and how far in or out the money is (less than $-15 \%,-15 \%$ to $-5 \%,-5 \%$ to $+5 \%,+5$ to $+15 \%$, greater than $+15 \%$ ).

## C10.5 Disclosures on insurer's internal capital model

Insurers may use their own stochastic internal capital model to determine their capital requirements for their variable annuity guarantee business on a one-year model with a 99\% TVaR threshold or a runoff model on a 95\% TVaR threshold. In addition, insurers will be required to disclose the capital requirements determined by their internal capital model reflecting both with hedging and without hedging. Lastly, model results relating to economic sensitivities, as prescribed by the BMA, and behavioural and actuarial sensitivities would be disclosed.

## C10.6 Actuarial memorandum

The insurer must file an actuarial memorandum with the Authority that should minimally include the particulars described below. When the information is already available in other documents within the capital and solvency return, it is acceptable to attach those documents and simply make reference to them in the actuarial memorandum. The insurer should indicate any significant changes from the last memorandum filed with the Authority.

## C11. SCHEDULE OF COMMERCIAL INSURER'S SOLVENCY SELFASSESSMENT (SCHEDULE IX)

## Background

C11.1 The Commercial Insurer's Solvency Self-Assessment (CISSA) is a regime that requires insurers to perform an assessment of their own risk and solvency requirements. This provides the BMA with the insurer's perspective of the capital resources (referred to as CISSA capital) necessary to achieve its business strategies and remain solvent given its risk profile, as well as insight into the risk management and governance procedures surrounding this process. The risk profile considers all reasonably foreseeable material risks arising from its operations or operational environment. Insurers should perform this assessment on an unconsolidated basis, with the exception of internal to regulatory capital level which should be done on a consolidated basis.

C11.2 The CISSA is one of the tools used in the supervisory review process to assist in monitoring compliance with the Insurance Code of Conduct (Code), given that the CISSA should, at a minimum, consider those risks outlined in the Code.

C11.3 The CISSA process should be integrated into the insurer's decision-making process and serve a critical role in the development, implementation and monitoring of management strategies. This is referred to as the 'use test'.

## Items

C11.4 The schedule of CISSA — Schedule IX — shall provide particulars of the following matters:

a) CISSA capital summary and additional information - disclosing the insurer's own capital computations, insurer's comparison of the CISSA capital to regulatory capital, insurer's plans for raising additional capital and contingency arrangements impacting the available capital.

b) CISSA general questions - providing information on an insurer's risk management and governance programme, the review and approval of the CISSA, and integration of the CISSA into the strategic decision-making process.

c) CISSA assessment of material risks of the insurer - providing information on an insurer's assessment of material risks, determination of both the quality and quantity of capital required to cover its risks, the forward-looking analysis and its ability to manage its capital needs, the review and approval of the CISSA and the governance and controls surrounding model(s)/tool(s) used to compute the CISSA capital.

## Additional Guidance

## Risk Management Policy in lieu of CISSA Report

C11.i. If the insurer's Risk Management Policy is used to assess and monitor strategic goals and it minimally addresses Schedule IX(c), items 1-11, it can be submitted in lieu of the CISSA Report. This would also apply for an insurer's Code of Conduct assessment, Risk Framework, Underwriting Framework, and other internal documents. Insurers should include a reference table that identifies the CISSA disclosure within the submitted attachment(s) (e.g., CISSA item 3 is covered in the Risk Management Policy, section 5 (pages 40-44)). Note that any documents referenced in these Risk Management Policy (or other such document) shall be submitted as part of the submission package.

## C12. SCHEDULE OF ELIGIBLE CAPITAL (SCHEDULE XII)

## Background

C12.1 The schedule of eligible capital — Schedule XII — requires insurers to assess the quality of their capital resources eligible to satisfy their regulatory capital requirement levels. The insurer should report their Eligible Capital on an EBS basis.

C12.2 The purpose of this schedule is to consider the uniqueness of capital instruments in their ability to protect policyholders on a going concern basis, run-off basis and during times of distress such as a winding-up or insolvency in the determination of capital adequacy.

C12.3 The schedule also takes into consideration that in times of stress situations, the excess of pledged assets that support policyholder obligations are not available to all policyholder until the obligations of the underlying policyholders have been satisfied. Therefore the statutory surplus must be adjusted to recognise the limited accessibility of these assets. Thus this excess of funds is transferred from Tier 1 to Tier 2 Capital which is calculated in Tier 1 Basic Capital item (h).

C12.4 Further the Authority considers that it would be too punitive that an insurer maintains capital for these excess of funds for policyholder obligations that have been transferred from Tier 1 to Tier 2 capital, and therefore section (h)(vi) to (h)(xiii) reduces the capital factor charges associated with those assets. The additional guidance provides details on how this capital factor calculation should be completed

C12.5 Refer to the Eligible Capital Rules 2012 for details. A copy of these Rules is available in the BMA website.

## Additional Guidance

## Insurer does not have any Encumbered Assets for Policyholder Obligations

C12.i. If the insurer does not have any encumbered assets for policyholder obligations, the insurer shall report the full amount of Best Estimate Technical Provisions in column A, line iv - contracts where policyholder obligations are not collateralised.

## Reporting Encumbered Assets for Policyholder Obligations

C12.ii. When calculating the excess encumbered assets capital charge in section (h)(vi), this shall be done as follows:

- Encumbered Assets - determine the capital charge for the assets reported in section (h)(i), and reduce the capital charge by the insurer's overall capital diversification.

For example if the insurer has encumbered assets in a trust equal to $\$ 8,000$ which is allocated as:

| Asset | Amount | BSCR Capital Factor | Required Capital |
| :--- | ---: | :---: | ---: |
| Cash BSCR Rating 1 | $\$ 3,000$ | $0.1 \%$ | $\$ 3.00$ |
| Sovereign Bonds | $\$ 2,000$ | $0.0 \%$ | $\$ 0.00$ |
| Corporate Bonds <br> Rating 1 | $\$ 500$ | $0.4 \%$ | $\$ 2.00$ |
| Corporate Bonds | $\underline{\$ 5,500}$ | $\underline{1.5 \%}$ | $\underline{\$ 37.50}$ |
| Rating 3 | $\mathbf{\$ 8 , 0 0 0}$ |  | $\mathbf{\$ 4 2 . 5 0}$ |
| Total |  |  |  |

In the same example, the insurer has BSCR prior to covariance of $\$ 1,500$ and the BSCR after covariance adjustment of $\$ 1,200$, the diversification credit is 0.8 . This is shown as follows:

| Regulatory Capital | Amount | Comments |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| BSCR prior to covariance | $\$ 1,500$ |  |
| BSCR after covariance | $\$ 1,200$ |  |
| Diversification | 0.8 | BSCR after covariance adjustment divided by <br> BSCR prior to covariance adjustment $(1200 / 1500)$ |

Finally apply the diversification credit to the assets held in the trust's capital factor:

| Regulatory capital | Amount |
| :--- | ---: |
| Asset in Trust capital factor | $\$ 42.50$ |
| Diversification credit | $\underline{0.8}$ |
| Capital requirements arising from encumbered assets | $\underline{\mathbf{\$ 4 . 0 0}}$ |

## C13. SCHEDULE OF REGULATED NON-INSURANCE FINANCIAL OPERATING ENTITIES (SCHEDULE XVI)

## Background

C13.1 The schedule of Regulated Non-Insurance Financial Operating Entities — Schedule XVI - shall calculate the insurer's regulatory capital requirement for regulated noninsurance financial operating entities and shall form part of the insurer's charge for capital adjustment, which is added to the BSCR (after covariance adjustment) amount to arrive at the BSCR.

C13.2 This shall apply to all entities where the insurer exercises either control or significant influence. In determining whether the parent company controls or significant influence over a regulated non-insurance financial operating member of the group, the definitions contained in the U.S., United Kingdom (U.K)., or Canadian GAAP or International Reporting Standards (IFRS), as applicable, shall apply.

## Insurers to include in the report

C14.i. The insurer should at a minimum include the details of the Bermuda entity (note that the regulatory capital requirement for the Bermuda entity would be the MSM).

C14.ii. If the insurer has other entities that have been included in the consolidated statutory statements, then these amounts would be reported gross (prior to consolidation).

## C15. SCHEDULE OF PARTICULARS OF CEDED REINSURANCE (SCHEDULE XVIII)

## Background

C15.1 To assess the risk of amounts reported in Funds Held By Ceding Reinsurers (Form 4EBS, line 12(c)), the Authority requires insurers to determine the arrangement in which the funds are being held. In the event of default, if the Company bears the risk (as well as the market risk of the valuation of investments), then these amounts are to be reported in Schedule IIA, Schedule of Funds Held by Ceding Reinsurers in Segregated Accounts/Trusts by BSCR Rating; if the reinsurer bears the risk of the assets held, then these amounts are to be reported on Schedule XVIII - Schedule of Particulars of Ceded Reinsurance.

C15.2 Particulars of reinsurance balances shall disclose at least the ten largest reinsurance exposures with the remaining reinsurance exposures grouped according to BSCR ratings and/or a single consolidated reinsurance exposure-

a) The name of reinsurer;

b) The BSCR rating;

c) The amount of reinsurance balances receivable, funds held by ceding reinsurers, and reinsurance recoverable balance (as reflected in Form 4EBS, lines 11(e), 12(c) and 27(c));

d) Funds held by ceding reinsurers (as reflected in Form 4EBS, line 12(c)), in paragraph (c) above, shall be included only to the extent that they are not already included under Schedule IIA;

e) The amount of reinsurance balances payable and other payables (as reflected in Form 4EBS, lines 28, 29, 33, and 34(c)) to the extent that they are attributable to that particular reinsurer or reinsurance exposure balance and there is a contractual right of set-off;

f) The amount of any collateral placed in favour of the insurer relating to the reinsurance balances (as reflected in the Notes to Form 4EBS, Lines 11(e) and 27(c));

g) The amount of qualifying collateral shall be the collateral amount in (f) less a $2 \%$ reduction to account for the market risk associated with the underlying collateral assets but, at all times, the qualifying collateral shall not exceed the net exposure, which is the difference between the amounts in (c) and (e);

h) The net qualifying exposure shall be the amount under (c) less the amounts under both (e) and (g) above;
i) for the purposes of this Schedule, the appropriate BSCR rating shall be determined as follows-

(i) the BSCR rating shall be based on either the rating of the reinsurer or the rating of the letters of credit issuer, if any, whichever is higher;

(ii) where the letters of credit do not relate to the entire reinsurance exposure, the reinsurance exposure should be separated to reflect the rating of that portion of the exposure which is covered by the letters of credit and the rating of that portion of the exposure which is not;

(iii) where the reinsurer is a domestic affiliate, it shall be assigned a BSCR rating of 0 regardless of its credit rating;

(iv) where a reinsurer is not rated but is regulated in a jurisdiction that applies the International Association of Insurance Supervisors' Insurance Core Principles (IAIS' ICPs) and in particular imposes both a minimum capital requirement and a Prescribed Capital Requirement (PCR) and fully meets its PCR in that jurisdiction, it shall be assigned a BSCR rating of 4 or otherwise, it shall be assigned a BSCR rating of 8; and

(v) where the insurer has disclosed a single consolidated reinsurance exposure, that exposure shall be assigned a BSCR rating of 8;

(vi) insurance financial strength ratings, reflecting the claims paying ability of (re)insurers, issued by the recognised credit rating agencies shall be used for the purposes of this schedule; the corresponding BSCR ratings shall be determined in the same manner as specified in sections C2.1a to C2.11 instructions affecting Schedule II.

## Additional Guidance

## Premiums Receivables to be reported on line 10 of Balance Sheet

C15.i. The Authority would like to confirm that premiums receivables should typically be captured under line 10 of the balance sheet and not line 11. Reinsurance receivables are typically those recoverables that have now been crystallised - hence both reinsurance receivables and recoverables are assessed together from a credit risk perspective. Additionally, the Authority confirms that the line 33 offset against reinsurance balances should only apply to the extent that they are attributable to a specific reinsurer

## Capital Risk charge based on nature of the arrangement

C15.ii. For funds held by ceding companies, the capital risk charge is calculated by the nature of the arrangement.

a) Where specific assets have been allocated for the benefit of the reinsurer, such that the reinsurer bears market risk on those assets, the Authority requires insurers to look through to the underlying assets, and report these balances on Schedule IIA. This effectively adds to the fixed income risk and equity risk modules similar to Schedule II.

b)Where there are no specific identified assets, the reinsurer is effectively in a similar position to a typical cedant with reinsurer exposure. Thus, the amounts will be treated similarly to reinsurance recoveries and shall be reported on Schedule XVIII Particulars of Ceded Reinsurers. Further, the rating for reinsurance exposures should be based on the financial strength ratings of the insurer.

## C16. SCHEDULE OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT COUNTERPARTY ANALYSIS (SCHEDULE XIX)

C16.1 For assessing the underlying credit security of cash and cash equivalent counterparties, the Authority is requiring insurers to provide details of the largest 10 exposures and the rating of those institutions. The remaining balance can be aggregated by BSCR rating (which is a similar methodology to the Schedule of Particulars of Ceded Reinsurance).

## Instructions Affecting Schedule XIX

C16.i. Cash and cash equivalent balances are to be reported based on its BSCR Rating;

C16.ii. An insurer may disclose at least the top ten cash and cash counterparty exposures (as reflected in Form 4EBS and Schedule IIA column 1, line 27);

C16.iii. The remaining balance may be grouped according to BSCR rating;

C16.iv. All unreconciled balances shall be allocated to the single consolidated exposure balance that receives a BSCR Rating of 8 ;

C16.v. Cash and cash equivalents issued by a country that is rated AA- or better in its own currency shall be classified under BSCR rating class 0 ;

C16.vi. Insurers may allocate BSCR Ratings based on the short-term ratings in the table below, or alternatively based on the long-term ratings detailed in Schedule II, in each case following the process specified in the instructions affecting Schedule II;

C16.vii. Amounts shall be reported on both an unconsolidated and consolidated EBS basis. Nevertheless, if an insurer does not have entities to consolidate, enter consolidated EBS information only.

## C17. SCHEDULE OF CURRENCY RISK (SCHEDULE XX)

C17.1 For insurers that write business in multiple currencies, the Authority has developed a capital charge for each currency where the insurer's liabilities may exceed its assets. For the grounds of proportionality, the Authority is requiring insurers to provide currency exposures for at least $95 \%$ of total assets and liabilities held.

C17.2 A capital charge is applied for those currencies for which the assets in the currency are less than the sum of the liabilities denominated in the currency plus a proxy BSCR for that currency. The capital charge of $25 \%$ is applied to the difference between the liabilities plus proxy BCSR for the currency and the assets held in that currency. The proxy BSCR for a given currency shall be calculated as the product of the liabilities in that currency and the proxy BSCR factor. The Proxy BSCR factor is calculated as the total statutory liabilities found on Form 1EBS line 39 divided by the total ECR Charge. The proxy BSCR factor shall be the maximum of:

a) The prior year value; or

b) Average of the last 3 years.

## Instructions Affecting Schedule XX

C17.2a At least 95\% of an insurer's total liabilities by currency based on the EBS shall be included;

C17.2b GrossCurrast ${ }_{i}$ and GrossCurrliab Brall be valued in line with the EBS principles set $^{\text {s }}$ out in Schedule XIV;

C17.2c Where an insurer uses currency hedging arrangements to manage its currency risk, then Currast $_{i}$ and Currliab $_{i}$ may reflect the impact of those arrangements onGrossCurrast ${ }_{i}$ and GrossCurrliab G $_{i}$ of a $25 \%$ adverse movement in foreign exchange rates, otherwise the amounts Gross Currast $_{i}$ and GrossCurrliab Ghall apply; $_{i}$

C17.2d A 'currency hedging arrangement' means derivative or other risk mitigation arrangements designed to reduce losses due to foreign currency exchange movements, and which meet the Authority's requirements to be classed as such; and

C17.2e Amounts shall be reported on both an unconsolidated and consolidated EBS basis. Nevertheless, if an insurer does not have entities to consolidate, enter consolidated EBS information only.

## Additional Guidance

## Calculating the BSCR Proxy

C17.i. When calculating the BSCR Proxy, insurers are to provide Liabilities (on an EBS basis) and total full (old basis) ECR capital charge on an EBS basis for the prior 3 years. In the instance the insurer does not have liabilities and the ECR capital charge on an EBS basis, the Authority will allow insurers to provide the unconsolidated balances for each. Note that for financial year-ends within the BSCR transitional period, insurers are to report the full old-basis BSCR for that period.

C17.ii. If the insurer does not have either liabilities or ECR capital charge for the prior 3 years,

a) Insurers filing their BSCR for the first time are to use current year figures for the prior year; and

b)Insurers that have previously filed a BSCR, yet do not have 3 years of historical data shall provide the years they have data for, and leave the years with no data reported as blank

## Meeting the 95\% minimum Asset and Liability test

C17.iii. If an insurer does not meet the $95 \%$ minimum test on this schedule regarding how it will impact the BMA's risk assessment of the insurer.

a) The Authority may require additional information from the insurer to assess its currency risk. This may result in a capital add-on which will require the insurer's ECR and TCL ratios to be revised on its published Financial Condition Report.

## Reporting Assets and Liabilities with hedging arrangements

C17.iv. For insurers that have been provided approval from the Authority for including hedging arrangements in their currency risk schedule, they shall report the total asset and liability of such currency hedge before and after the hedging arrangement.

Example: If an insurer had \$1.2 million in USD Assets, \$0.75 million in USD Liabilities; £0.5 million in Sterling Pound Assets and $£ 0.4$ million in Sterling Pound Liabilities; $\$ 0.25$ million in Canadian Dollar Assets and \$0.10 million in Canadian Dollar Liabilities; which the insurer had an approved asset hedge of $\$ 0.2$ million from USD to Sterling pound, this would be represented as follows:

| Currency | Assets | Assets with Hedging <br> Arrangements | Liabilities | Liabilities with <br> Hedging Arrangements |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| USD | $\$ 1.2 \mathrm{M}$ | $\$ 1.0 \mathrm{M}$ | $\$ 0.75 \mathrm{M}$ | $\$ 0.75 \mathrm{M}$ |
| Sterling Pound | $£ 0.5 \mathrm{M}$ | $£ 0.7 \mathrm{M}$ | $£ 0.4 \mathrm{M}$ | $£ 0.4 \mathrm{M}$ |
| Canadian Dollar | $\$ 0.25 \mathrm{M}$ |  | $\$ 0.10 \mathrm{M}$ |  |

## C18. SCHEDULE OF CONCENTRATION RISK (SCHEDULE XXI)

## Background

C18.1 To assess the insurer's concentration risk, the Authority requires the identification of largest 10 independent exposures relating to all instruments (such as equity holdings, bonds, real estate, loans, etc.), which would be an addition to the existing BSCR market and/or credit risk contributed by those exposures.

C18.2 In deciding which counterparties need to be grouped together, a single counterparty should include all related/connected counterparties, which are defined as:

a) Control relationship: one of the counterparties, directly or indirectly, has control over the other(s); and

b) Economic inter-dependence: if one of the counterparties were to experience financial problems, in particular funding or repayment difficulties, the other(s) as a result, would also be likely to encounter funding or repayment difficulties.

## Instructions Affecting Schedule XXI

C18.2a Disclosure of an insurer's ten largest exposures to single counterparty risk by reporting the name, the exposure and allocation by asset type, bond / mortgage type (if applicable), BSCR Rating (if applicable) and asset value consistent with Form 4EBS.

C18.2b A counterparty shall include all related/connected counterparties defined as:

a) Control relationship: if the counterparty, directly or indirectly, has control over the other(s); and

b) Economic interdependence: if one of the counterparties were to experience financial problems, in particular funding or repayment difficulties, the other(s) as a result, would also be likely to encounter funding or repayment difficulties.

C18.2c Asset type (column A) shall be one of the following lines taken from Form 4EBS;

a) Cash and Cash Equivalents (line 1)

b) Quoted Investments (line 2)

c) Unquoted Investments (line 3)

d) Investments in and Advances to Affiliates (line 4)

e) Investments in Mortgage Loans on Real estate (line 5)

f) Policy Loans (line 6)

g) Real Estate (line 7)

h) Collateral Loans (line 8)

i) Funds Held by Ceding Reinsurers (line 12)

C18.2d Asset sub-type (column B) shall provide further details of the type of asset as included in table 1, table 2 or table 8 as appropriate;

C18.2e BSCR Rating (column C) shall be the BSCR rating that was allocated to the asset when it was included in table 1 , table 2 or table 8 as appropriate;

C18.2f Asset Value (column D) shall be the value of the asset as required by the EBS valuation principles as set out in Schedule XIV; and

C18.2g Amounts shall be reported on both an unconsolidated and consolidated EBS basis. Nevertheless, if an insurer does not have entities to consolidate, enter consolidated EBS information only.

## Additional Guidance

## Reporting largest 10 independent exposures

C18.ii. Complete the schedule by providing the 10 largest independent exposures relating to all instruments (e.g., equity holdings, bonds, real estate, loans, etc.) largest counterparties. If a counterparty has more than one BSCR rating or Asset Type, enter each rating separately (i.e., if an insurer has purchased bonds and preferred shares of a company, then the insurer is to report 'Asset type' as 'Bond types'; "Bond / Mortgage Loan type" as the applicable bond type, and 'BSCR Rating' as the rating of the bond in one line. In the second line, the insurer is to report the 'Asset Type' as 'Preferred Shares' and 'BSCR Rating' as the rating of the shares.

## Hedge funds

C18.iii. When counterparty exposure to collective investment funds as hedge funds and diversified fund-of-one structures, insurers are to report the portfolio on a look-though basis.

## Investment in Affiliates types

C18.iv. For investment in affiliates, allocate based on the following categories:

a) Regulated entity - an entity that files to a regulatory body or supervisory authority; Note that each regulated entity is required to provide the RCR equivalent to the BMA's ECR;

b) Operating entity - is an entity that sells products and takes on business risk;

c) Unregulated entities that conduct ancillary services - refers to unregulated entities that provide support services to the primary activities of an insurer (this would include marketing, information;

d) Unregulated non-financial operating entities - refers to an entity that sells products and takes on business risk (e.g., department stores and automobile sales); and

e) Unregulated financial operating entities - refers to an entity that sells financial instruments (e.g., Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and weather derivatives).

## C19. INSURER RISK ASSESSMENT

## Background

C19.1 The Commercial Insurer Risk Assessment (CIRA) framework assesses the quality of the risk management function surrounding the insurer's operational risk exposures. Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or external events. Operational risk also includes legal risks. Reputational risks arising from strategic decisions do not count as operational risks. The CIRA framework emphasises the interrelationships between the Risk Management and Corporate Governance functions as seen below:

<img src="https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_18_bd6cd19252d07a322e1bg-095.jpg?height=891&width=1675&top_left_y=823&top_left_x=236" alt="image" style="width:100%;height:auto;">

C19.2 The Board of Directors has an influential role in establishing, inter alia, the strategic direction and risk culture of the insurer. The BMA views the Risk Management function as a critical tool to furnish the board with the necessary information to make appropriate decisions and assist the insurer's management in steering the organisation forward.

C19.3 The Risk Management function within the CIRA has four components: Risk Identification, Risk Measurement, Risk Response, and Risk Monitoring \& Reporting. The insurer will undertake the self-assessment by answering the questions related to the calibre of its risk management processes in place to address the material risk arising from each operational risk area.

C19.4 The CIRA framework embodies a maturity model approach to identify an insurer's developmental stage with respect to a specific operational risk area. It rewards the insurer for achieving progress in each risk management area. It reviews the following eight operational risk exposures as follows:

a) Business Processes Risk - includes a risk of errors arising from data entry, data processing, or application design.

b) Business Continuity Risk - includes a risk of an event that threatens or disrupts an insurer's continuous operations.

c) Compliance Risk - includes a risk of legal or regulatory breaches or both.

d) Information System Risk - includes a risk of unauthorised access to systems and data, data loss, utility disruptions, software and hardware failures, and inability to access information systems.

e) Distribution Channels Risk - includes a risk of disruption to an insurer's distribution channel arising from employment of inexperienced or incapable brokers or agents.

f) Fraud Risk - includes a risk of misappropriation of assets, information theft, forgery, or fraudulent claims.

g) Human Resources Risk - includes a risk of employment of unethical staff, inexperience or incapable staff, failure to train or retain experienced staff, and failure to adequately communicate with staff.

h) Outsourcing Risk - includes a risk of miscommunication of responsibilities in relation to outsourcing, breach of outsource service agreements or entering into inappropriate service agreements.

C19.5 The CIRA framework applies the components within the Risk Management function to each operational risk area. The insurer assesses each operational risk area and selects the applicable descriptor under the 'Dimension' column that reflects the developmental stage of the insurer's process surrounding the specific risk area.

C19.6 In order to be credited for a relevant score within the CIRA Framework, the insurer must fulfill the criteria in the 'Dimension' column. In its assessment, if the insurer finds itself between stages, the insurer must select the lower stage. The insurer can supplement the selection with additional comments that can be made at the end of each risk management function.

C19.7 The total scores for each component within the CIRA Framework are aggregated and produce the pertinent Operational Risk Charge percentage. The Operational Risk Charge ranges from $1 \%$ to $10 \%$. The relevant Operational Risk Charge percentage is applied to the 'BSCR (After Covariance Adjustment)' subtotal. The resultant figure is the Operational Risk Capital Charge.

## Items for Class D and $\mathrm{E}$ Insurers

## C20. SCHEDULE OF FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS BY BSCR RATING (SCHEDULE IIB)

## Background

C20.1 The schedule of fixed income and equity investments by BSCR rating (Schedule IIB), provides a breakdown of an insurer's:

a) Bonds and Debentures by both investment category (Corporate \& Sovereign Bonds, Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities, Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities/Asset-Backed Securities and Bond Mutual Funds) and BSCR ratings (Ratings 0-8);

b) Equity Investments by asset category (Long Exposures, Short Exposures for Qualifying Assets held for Risk Mitigation Purposes and Short Exposures for NonQualifying as Assets for Risk Mitigating Purposes) and liability category (Without Management Actions and with Management Actions);

c) Spread risk for credit derivatives by spread up (for long and short exposures) and spread down (for long and short exposures);

d) Counterparty default risk for over-the-counter derivatives by market value of derivatives with positive market values, market value of derivatives with negative market value and market value of collateral excluding any over collateralisation; and

e) Cash and Cash Equivalents

The amounts reported on Schedule IIB should reflect the balances as shown on Form 4EBS lines 2(f) Quoted Investments, 3(f) Unquoted investments, 4(f) Investment in Affiliates, 5(c) Investment in Mortgage Loan on Real Estate, 7(c) Real Estate and 13(a) Derivatives after look-through (where applicable).

C20.2 This schedule applies a capital charge to fixed income investments based on the type of category and rating of the security held; and a shock to equity investments based on the type of investment. The fixed income and equity charges are aggregated in the fixed income and equity risk tabs, respectively. Further this information provides the BMA with the type and quality of investments held for assessing the insurer's market risk. It is noted that the balances reported on this schedule are to be included in:

a) Where interest-rate sensitive, to be included in Interest Rate/Liquidity Risk charge calculation along with the interest-rate sensitive values reported on Schedules IIC - IIF; and

b) Balances in Schedule XIXA Cash and Cash Equivalents.

## Items

C20.3 The schedule is broken into five separate sections for which the total of each should, after reconciling for look-through, correspond to balances reported on Form 4EBS for the relevant year. In the absence of look-through, the following (points a-d) should hold.

a) Quoted and unquoted bonds and debentures, and Investment in Mortgage Loans on Real Estate - line 14, column (11) 'Total' corresponds to Form 4EBS, line 2(b), 3 (b) and 5(c);
b) Quoted and unquoted equities - line 37, column (11) 'Total' corresponds to Form 4EBS, line 2(d), 3(d), 4(f) and 7(c);

c) Derivatives instruments - line 47, columns (1, 3, 6 and 8) and line 57, columns (1, 2 and 3) corresponds to Form 4EBS 13(a);

d) Cash and Cash Equivalents - line 58, column (1) corresponds to cash and cash equivalents from hedge funds as reported on Form 4EBS lines 2(e) and 3(e); and

e) Quoted and unquoted investments corresponds to hedge funds as reported on Form 4EBS lines 2(e) and 3(e) - is to be reported on a look-through basis and allocated in sections a-d above.

## Instructions Affecting Schedule IIB

C20.3a Fixed income investments, both quoted and unquoted, shall be categorised into corporate bonds and sovereign bonds, residential MBS, commercial MBS/asset-backed securities, and bond mutual funds and classified by BSCR rating;

C20.3b Equity investments, both quoted and unquoted, shall be categorised into long exposures; short exposures qualifying as assets held for risk-mitigation purposes in accordance with criteria prescribed in section B4; and short exposures not qualifying as assets held for risk-mitigation purposes in accordance with criteria prescribed in section B4 and are further required to be classified by strategic holdings, duration based, listed equity securities, preferred stocks, other equities, letters of credit, intangible assets, pension benefit surplus, infrastructure, derivatives and real estate;

C20.3c Preferred stock shall be classified by BSCR rating;

C20.3d The BSCR ratings for fixed income securities and preferred stocks shall be determined in the manner specified in the instructions affecting Schedule II;

C20.3e Where_a security is rated differently by various rating agencies, the insurer shall classify the security according to the most conservative rating assigned;

C20.3f Unrated securities shall be assigned a BSCR rating of 8;

C20.3g Sovereign debt issued by a country in its own currency that is rated AA- or better shall be classified under BSCR rating 0; while all other sovereign bonds are required to be classified in a manner similar to corporate bonds;

C20.3h Debt issued by government-owned or entities that are explicitly guaranteed by that government, (except government issued MBS), shall be assigned a BSCR rating of 0 , provided that the country is rated AA- or better and the debt is in the local currency of the country and otherwise classified in a similar manner as corporate bonds;

C20.3i 'Exposures' shall include those determined by the application of the 'look-through' approach calculated in accordance with criteria prescribed in section B6 for collective investment vehicles and other investments packaged as funds;

C20.3j 'Strategic holdings' refers to holdings in qualifying equity investments of a strategic nature which meet the criteria prescribed in section B7.7 for such holdings. Where such investments are listed on a designated stock exchange or are investments in certain funds both meeting criteria prescribed by the Authority, then such investments will be classified as 'Type 1'. Investments that do not meet such criterion shall be classified as 'Type 2'.

C20.3k 'Infrastructure' refers to holdings in qualifying equity infrastructure investments which meet criteria prescribed in section B7.3 for such investments that are non-strategic holdings.

C20.3l 'Listed equity securities in developed markets' refers to holdings in equity securities listed on designated stock exchanges or investments in certain funds prescribed in section B7.6 Certain qualifying unlisted equity investments may also be included under this category instead of the 'Other equities' category under conditions set out in section B7.4.

C20.3m 'Other equities' shall include holdings in quoted and unquoted equity investments that are not reported in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs '(j)' and '(l)' above; or not listed herein as an 'Equity Holding' in this schedule (i.e., equities not listed on a designated stock exchange prescribed by the Authority, hedge funds, commodities and other alternative investments);

C20.3n Best estimate insurance liabilities and other liabilities (excluding risk margin) whose value is subject to equity risk are to be included in lines 15 to 36 ;

C20.3o Exposures qualifying as assets held for risk-mitigation purposes, and exposures not qualifying as assets held for risk-mitigation purposes; shall be determined in accordance with criteria prescribed in section B4;

C20.3p For all exposures other than derivatives, a default calculation of after-shock value is provided to expedite the filling of the schedule. It is expected that the default calculation will be appropriate in the majority of cases ${ }^{4}$; however, the insurer always needs to review the appropriateness and approve any resulting values. If the default formula is not appropriate for certain asset class, or for certain instruments within an asset class, the insurer is responsible for entering correct after-shock values by overriding the default formula; and

C20.3q For derivatives, no default formula can be provided due to the non-linearity of the change in value. That is, the change in derivative value (in percentages) is generally different from the shock (in percentages) that is applied to the underlying of the derivative.

## Additional Guidance

## Applying a BSCR Rating to unquoted internally rated investments

C20.i. Insurers that have developed an internal rating for unquoted investments shall apply a BSCR rating of 8. Nevertheless, if an insurer would like to request permission to use an equivalent scale of these investments in their BSCR filing, the insurer shall request such permission in writing to the BMA and include details on the internal rating assessment and a proposed equivalent scale to the BSCR Rating scale. Only upon approval shall the insurer reclassify an unquoted investment from BSCR Rating 8.

## GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC are not eligible for BSCR Rating 0

C20.ii. Securities that have a BSCR rating 0 have been defined as 'Sovereign debt issued by a country in its own currency that is rated AA- or better', however the Authority would like to acknowledge that Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) are not eligible for the sovereign bond classification BSCR Rating 0 and shall be reported under Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS). While the Authority acknowledges that an explicit government guarantee applies to the credit risk for GNMA-insured mortgages uncertainty remains with the timing of the mortgage loan repayments. Consequently, the Authority does not extend the sovereign debt treatment to MBS.

## MBS to use NAIC Rating for securities issued prior to 2008

C20.iii. MBS do not always adequately reflect the risk associated with being held at less than par value. For this reason, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has modeled these bonds and provides US insurers with a rating reclassification. The Authority shall allow insurers the option to use these reclassifications when summarising their portfolio for securities that were issued prior to 2008. The Authority requires insurers to provide a separate summary of the Form 4EBS value by BSCR rating class, both before and after the adjustment.

The NAIC reclassifications of MBS will be assigned to the BSCR ratings classes according to the following table:

| BSCR Rating <br> Class | NAIC <br> (for MBS Only) |
| :---: | :---: |
| 0 |  |
| 1 |  |
| 2 | 1 |
| 3 | 2 |
| 4 | 3 |
| 5 | 4 |
| 6 | 5 |
| 8 | 6 |

Some Residential MBS bonds are not directly modeled by the NAIC, including bonds held by insurers that do not have a United States presence. The NAIC provides a documented four-step process as part of its SSAP No. 43R for reclassifying such bonds based on their rating and their Form 4EBS value relative to par. The Authority shall allow companies to optionally follow this process in classifying bonds that have not been formally reclassified by the NAIC.

## Affiliated balances

C20.iv. Investments in Affiliates are to be treated like any other financial investment unless they fulfil the criteria prescribed in section B7.7 as 'Strategic Holdings'. Otherwise, the affiliate investment is to be allocated as an equity holding in lines 1536 .

## C21. SCHEDULE OF FUNDS HELD (SCHEDULE IIC)

## Background

C21.1 To assess the risk of amounts reported in Funds Held By Ceding Reinsurers (Form 4EBS, line 12(c)), the Authority requires insurers to determine the arrangement in which the funds are being held. In the event of default, if the reinsurer bears the risk of the assets held, then these amounts are to be reported on Schedule XVIII - Schedule of Particulars of Ceded Reinsurance; if the insurer bears the risk (as well as the market risk of the valuation of investments), then these amounts are to be reported in Schedule IIC - Schedule of Funds Held.

C21.2 The Schedule of Funds Held — Schedule IIC — provides the BMA with details to assess the type and quality of investment held by requiring the insurer to allocate the balances by investment category and BSCR Rating (similar to investments reported on Schedule IIB). Further the balances reported on Schedule IIC also are used in the calculation for the Interest Rate/Liquidity Risk and Cash and Cash Equivalents exposure.

C21.3 The investment categorization and BSCR ratings shall be based on the same rating scale and principles as those found on Schedule IIB.

## Items

## C26. SCHEDULE OF CURRENCY RISK (SCHEDULE XXA)

C26.1 For insurers that write business in multiple currencies, the Authority has developed a capital charge for each currency where the insurer's liabilities may exceed its assets. For the grounds of proportionality, the Authority is requiring insurers to provide currency exposures for at least $95 \%$ of total assets and liabilities held.

C26.2 For those currencies for which the assets in the currency are less than the sum of the liabilities denominated in the currency plus a proxy BSCR for that currency, shocks are applied to the assets and liabilities to determine a capital charge. The proxy BSCR for a given currency shall be calculated as the product of the liabilities in that currency and the proxy BSCR factor. The Proxy BSCR factor is calculated as the total liabilities found on Form 1EBS line 39 divided by the total ECR Charge. The proxy BSCR factor shall be the maximum of:

a) The prior year value; and

b) Average of the last 3 years.

## Instructions Affecting Schedule XXA

C26.2a Insurers shall report currencies representing not less than $95 \%$ of their economic balance sheet liabilities;

C26.2b Assets qualifying as held for risk mitigation purposes, assets not qualifying for risk mitigation purposes and liabilities without management actions shall be valued in line with the Economic Balance Sheet principles set out in Schedule XIV and in accordance with criteria prescribed by the Authority;

C26.2c Liabilities with management actions shall be valued in accordance with criteria prescribed in section B5 in relation to the valuation of future bonuses and other discretionary benefits;

C26.2d For all exposures other than Foreign Exchange (FX) derivatives, a default calculation of after-shock value is provided to expedite the filling of the schedule. It is expected that the default calculation will be appropriate in the majority of cases5; however, the insurer always needs to review the appropriateness and approve any resulting values. If the default formula is not appropriate for a certain asset class, or for certain instruments within an asset class, the insurer is responsible for entering correct after-shock values by overriding the default formula;

C26.2e For FX derivatives, no default formula can be provided, due to the non-linearity of the change in value. That is, the change in derivative value (in percentages) is generally[^3]different from the shock (in percentages) that is applied to the exchange rate underlying the derivative;

C26.2f Amounts shall be reported on both an EBS valuation and unconsolidated basis.

## Additional Guidance

## Calculating the BSCR Proxy

C26.i. When calculating the BSCR Proxy, insurers are to provide Liabilities (on an EBS basis) and the total full (new basis) ECR capital charge on an EBS basis for the prior 3 years. In the instance the insurer does not have liabilities and the ECR capital charge on an EBS basis, the Authority will allow insurers to provide the unconsolidated balances for each. Note that for financial year-ends within the BSCR transitory period, insurers are to report the full new-basis BSCR for that period.

C26.ii. If the insurer does not have either liabilities or ECR capital charge for the prior 3 years:

a) Insurers filing their BSCR for the first time are to use current year figures for the prior year; and

b)Insurers that have previously filed a BSCR however do not have 3 years of historical data shall provide the years they have data for, and leave the years with no data reported as blank

## Meeting the 95\% minimum Asset and Liability test

C26.iii. If an insurer does not meet the $95 \%$ minimum test on this schedule regard how it will impact the BMA's risk assessment of the insurer?

a) The Authority may require additional information from the insurer to assess its currency risk. This may result in a capital add-on which will require the insurer's ECR and TCL ratios to be revised on its published Financial Condition Report.

## Guidance for reporting currency shocks for FX forward positions

C26.iv. When reporting foreign exchange hedges on Schedule XXA, the before-shock market value is the fair value of the contract on an EBS basis, and should be already available without a need for separate calculations (from the financial statements/asset reports/asset system). The after-shock value is to be calculated by the insurer under the prescribed currency shocks, following standard market practices and using generally accepted models for valuation of specific assets.

(i) In particular, as the cash flows of an FX forward occur at its maturity, the forward exchange rate and the discount rate for the appropriate term should be used to value the FX forward, both at the valuation date and after the shock

(ii) For avoidance of doubt, the before-shock value (i.e. the EBS balance sheet value) and the after-shock value may be either positive or negative (or zero), depending on the specifics and the circumstances. As a result of the shock, a negative market
value may become more negative, less negative or positive; and a positive market value may become more positive, less positive or negative. Only the change in the market value matters, where the change is calculated as [Market Value Before Shock] minus [Market Value After Shock]

Below is a simplified example of the calculation of the after-shock value of an FX forward contract for illustration purposes. The example assumes that an insurer's reporting currency is USD, and that it has GBP-denominated liabilities in excess of GBP-denominated assets. The insurer, is therefore, exposed to the risk of GBP appreciating against the USD; or, equivalently, to the risk of USD depreciating against the GBP. Assume that the insurer has entered into an FX forward to sell USD (buy GBP) at a fixed price to hedge some of this risk.

(i) Let the GBP/USD rate entered be 1.3 (the forward rate/delivery price) and the insurer is selling 1,000 USD (this being the nominal amount). At the contractual rate, this is equivalent to buying 769.23 GBP. The market value of the FX forward at inception is, by definition, 0 . Assume the original maturity of the contract is $\mathrm{T}$ (in years).

(ii) Assume that, as of the valuation date (denote this by time t), the current GBP/USD forward rate for the period equal to the remaining maturity of the contract (i.e., T-t) is 1.5. This means that if the insurer were to enter into a new forward contract, at time $t$, to sell 1,000 USD for GBP at time T, it would receive 666.67 GBP at time $T$. Nevertheless, the delivery rate of the FX forward stays unchanged over the life of the contract and under the contract the insurer can get 769.23 GBP for 1,000 USD at the maturity, T. Therefore, ignoring discounting for the sake of simplicity in this example, the market value of the FX forward is equal to the difference, 102.56 GBP. (Alternatively, this can be thought of as closing the position by entering into an opposite contract (i.e., selling 666.67 GBP to receive 1,000 USD) at time T; the USD payments cancel at T, and the GBP legs yield a net profit of 769.23 - 666.67 = 102.56 GBP at T.) The GBP value then needs to be converted into the reporting currency (at the spot rate). Assuming that the spot GBP/USD rate at valuation date is, say, 1.4, the market value of the FX forward is 143.58 USD. This is the before-shock market value in Schedule XXA, which should correspond to the fair value at which the FX forward is recorded on the EBS balance sheet (after properly accounting for all the factors affecting the price of the forward, such as discounting the payoff from time $\mathrm{T}$ to present time $\mathrm{t}$ ).

(iii) Under the BSCR currency risk calculation - Schedule XXA - the FX forward is revalued under the prescribed currency shock. In this case, the shock is a $25 \%$ depreciation of the USD against GBP (or, equivalently, a 25\% appreciation of the GBP against the USD). The shocked GBP/USD forward rate is therefore 1.875 (assuming that neither the relevant USD nor GBP interest rates change as a result of the shock). At this rate, 1,000 USD could be sold forward for 533.33 GBP at the maturity T. Nevertheless, again, the forward contract entitles the insurer to receive 769.23 GBP for 1,000 USD. Therefore, the market value of the contract after the shock is 235.90 GBP (again ignoring discounting). Using the shocked spot rate of 1.75 (i.e., (1+25\%)*1.4),
the shocked market value is 412.83 USD. This is the after-shock market value in Schedule XXA.

(iv)The effect of the currency shock on the FX forward is the difference between the before and after-shock market values (i.e., an increase in value of 269.25 USD in this example). Note that the insurer needs to only fill the before-shock and after-shock values in Schedule XXA; the change in market value is then automatically calculated in the Currency Risk tab. This increase in the value of the FX forward would help to offset some of the increase, in USD terms, in the value of the GBP-denominated liabilities.

C26.v. Alternatively, instead of reporting the (net) market value of an FX forward contract, insurers may report both legs of the FX forward separately on Schedule XXA, with each leg allocated to the line for the appropriate currency. In this case, the sum of the reported (before-shock) values of the legs must be equal to the fair value, as of valuation date, of the FX forward contract as a whole. Similarly, the sum of the mark-to-model values of the legs after the shock should, by definition, be equal to the after-shock mark-to-model value of the contract as a whole, if the calculation is carried out correctly. That is, the market value of the contract, or the results of the shock calculation, shall not be affected by the chosen representation.

## C27. SCHEDULE OF CONCENTRATION RISK (SCHEDULE XXI)

## Background

C27.1 To assess the insurer's concentration risk, the Authority requires the identification of largest 10 independent exposures relating to all instruments (e.g., equity holdings, bonds, real estate, loans, etc.), which would be an addition to the existing BSCR market and/or credit risk contributed by those exposures.

C27.2 In deciding which counterparties need to be grouped, a single counterparty should include all related/connected counterparties, which are defined as:

a) Control relationship: one of the counterparties, directly or indirectly, has control over the other(s); and

b) Economic inter-dependence: if one of the counterparties were to experience financial problems, in particular funding or repayment difficulties, the other(s) as a result, would also be likely to encounter funding or repayment difficulties.

## Instructions Affecting Schedule XXI

C27.2b For the purposes of this Schedule, a counterparty shall include all related or connected counterparties captured by either of the following criteria:

a) Controller relationship: if a counterparty, directly or indirectly, has control of (as a result of its majority shareholding in or significant influence) the other counterparties; or

b) Economic interdependence: if one of the counterparties were to experience financial difficulties which directly or indirectly affect the ability of any or all of the remaining counterparties to perform their financial obligations (e.g., where a counterparty becomes unable to fund or repay certain financial contractual obligations, and as a result, other counterparties, are likely to be unable to fund or repay certain obligations imposed on them);

C27.2c Asset type (column A) shall be determined by the insurer as one of the following:

a) Cash and Cash Equivalents (as defined in Schedule XIX column B Schedules IIB, IIC, IID, IIE, and IIF column (1), line 68);

C27.2f Asset value (under column D) shall be the value of the asset as required by the EBS valuation principles as set out in Schedule XIV; and

C27.2g Amounts shall be reported on both an EBS valuation and unconsolidated basis.

## Additional Guidance

## Reporting Largest 10 Independent Exposures

C27.i. Complete the schedule by providing the 10 largest independent exposures relating to all instruments (e.g. equity holdings, bonds, real estate, loans, etc.) largest counterparties. If a counterparty has more than one BSCR rating or Asset Type, enter each rating separately (i.e., if an insurer has purchased bonds and preferred shares of a company, then the insurer is to report 'Asset Type' as 'Bond Types'; 'Bond/Mortgage Loan Type' as the applicable bond type, and 'BSCR Rating' as the rating of the bond in one line. In the second line, the insurer is to report the 'Asset Type' as 'Preferred Shares' and 'BSCR Rating' as the rating of the shares.

## C28. SCHEDULE OF INTEREST RATE SENSITIVE ASSETS AND

 LIABILITIES (SCHEDULE XXIII)
## Background

C28.1 An alternative and more risk sensitive method for determining capital requirements for interest and liquidity risk has been developed. This method will require companies to apply shocks to the yield curve used for determining best estimate liabilities (which includes segregated account company liabilities, deposit liabilities and sundry liabilities) and market values of assets (which includes segregated account company assets, deposit assets and sundry assets) exposed to interest rate risk (e.g., fixed income and hybrid assets, bank deposits, etc.). Any changes in market values of assets and best estimate liabilities due to interest rate-sensitive cash flows should be accounted for. The capital requirement is then determined as the negative change to the net asset value (net balance sheet) of the highest magnitude resulting from these shocks.

## Instructions Affecting Schedule XXIII

C28.1a The shock-based method requires companies to apply shocks to the yield curve used for determining best estimate liabilities ${ }^{6}$ and market values of assets ${ }^{7}$ exposed to interest rate risk (e.g., fixed income and hybrid assets, bank deposits, etc.). Any changes in market values of assets and best estimate liabilities due to interest rate-sensitive cash flows should be accounted for.

C28.1b Two shocks are to be applied: an upwards shock and a downwards shock. The capital requirement is then determined as the negative change to the net asset value (net balance sheet) of the highest magnitude resulting from these shocks.

C28.1c For the purposes of calculating capital requirements for interest rate risk, rates are allowed to go negative. If the application of the downward shock leads to negative rates, these shall not be floored at zero.

C28.1d For the calculation of the interest risk capital charge under the shock-based approach, hedging and risk transfer mechanisms should be taken into account as long as they comply with the requirements set in the Risk Mitigation Section of these instructions. Also, management actions should be taken into account as long as they comply with the requirements set in the Management Actions Section of these instructions.

Interaction between shock-based approach and interest rate risk captured in Variable Annuity (VA) guarantee risk

C28.1e - In order to prevent double-counting capital charges for VA guarantees when using the shock-based approach, the following provisions apply:

a) Where companies are using an internal model for Variable Annuity risk, assets and liabilities associated with VA guarantees may be excluded from the interest rate shock, if the following conditions are fulfilled:[^4](i) The company is able to identify and track assets associated with Variable Annuity guarantees.

(ii) Interest rate risk associated with both the VA guarantee liabilities and the associated assets is explicitly modeled in the internal model.

b) Where interest rate risk is modelled for VA guarantees, but not for the associated assets, or the associated assets cannot be separately identified, then the VA guarantee liabilities may be excluded from the interest rate shock, but any assets may not.

c) Where companies are using the BSCR Standard Formula to calculate Variable Annuity guarantee risk, only the VA guarantee liabilities may be excluded from the interest rate shock, but any assets may not.

## Additional Guidance

C28.i. The shocks (per currency) are to be applied to the valuation date spot curve (per currency). The shocks are absolute shocks expressed in percentage points (i.e., are added on top of the base spot curve).

a) For companies using the standard approach to calculate best estimate liability (BEL), the shocks are applied to the standard spot curves published by the Authority.

C28.ii. The assets and liabilities need to be revalued under the shocks. For assets, this involves calculating the market value of assets after the shock (i.e., the shocked value). Depending on the asset, this may be a mark-to-model calculation. Conceptually the shocked value corresponds to the expected present value of cash flows projected under the stress scenario (taking into account that the amount and/or timing of cash flows themselves might change due to the shock (e.g., for bonds with call/put options or for derivatives)).

C28.iii. Revaluing the (best estimate) liabilities involves calculating the expected present value of cash flows projected under the stress scenarios. In particular, where the amount and/or timing of liability cash flows themselves depends on interest rates, the liability cash flows need to be projected (re-evaluated) under the stress scenarios, as opposed to, for example, simply re-discounting the base scenario cash flows.

Interaction between shock-based approach and the scenario-based approach for BEL

C28.1f For companies using the scenario-based approach for BEL calculation there is an offset from the interest rate risk capital charge when the shock-based approach is used. The offset is based on the difference in the best estimate liability between the 'worst' scenario and the base scenario under the scenario-based approach, according to the formula specified in the Prudential Rules.

C28.1g As a simplification companies using the scenario-based approach may calculate the capital charge for interest rate risk (before the application of offset) based on shocks to the balance sheet as if the base scenario had been applied. In this case the offset is to be calculated as the difference between the 'worst' scenario and the base scenario before the application of shocks.

## D.SUMMARY

## D1. FEATURES - BSCR ON CURRENT BASIS

## Background

D1.1 The Summary exhibit has seven key features: Required Capital and Surplus, Available Statutory Capital and Surplus, MSM, ECR and TCL, Ratios, Solvency Capital Distribution chart and Regulatory Action Level graph. Each feature is described below. At the bottom of the page the BSCR formula for combining the various risk capital charges is displayed. The only financial data input into the Summary exhibit is the BMA-approved Capital Contribution of the insurer.

## Required Capital and Surplus

D1.2 The BSCR is determined according to the following formula:

<img src="https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_18_bd6cd19252d07a322e1bg-129.jpg?height=419&width=1616&top_left_y=1062&top_left_x=342" alt="image" style="width:100%;height:auto;">

Where:

$C_{f i}=$ capital charge in respect of fixed income investment risk;

$C_{e q} \quad=$ capital charge in respect of equity investment risk capital;

$C_{\text {LTint }}=$ capital charge in respect of interest rate and liquidity risk;

$C_{\text {curr }}=$ capital charge in respect of currency risk;

$C_{\text {conc }}=$ capital charge in respect of concentration risk;

$C_{\text {LTcred }}=$ capital charge in respect of credit risk capital;

$C_{\text {LTmort }}=$ capital charge in respect of long-term insurance risk - mortality;

$C_{L T s l}=$ capital charge in respect of long-term insurance risk - stop loss;

$C_{L T r}=$ capital charge in respect of long-term insurance risk - riders;

$C_{\text {LTmorb }}=$ capital charge in respect of long-term insurance risk - morbidity and disability;
$C_{\text {LTlong }}=$ capital charge in respect of long-term insurance risk - longevity;

$C_{L T V A}=$ capital charge in respect of long-Term variable annuity guarantee risk;
b) $C_{\text {LToth }}=$ capital charge in respect of long-term other insurance risk;

$C_{o p}=$ capital charge in respect of operational risk; and

$C_{a d j}=$ capital charge adjustment, calculated as the sum of (a) and (b) where:

(a) Regulatory capital requirement for regulated non-insurance financial operating entities;

(b) Capital adjustment for the loss absorbing capacity of deferred taxes.

$B S C R C_{\text {corr }}=$ as calculated in accordance with paragraph D16.2;

TransitionalFactor

(a) $10 \%$, for the financial year beginning on or after $1^{\text {St }}$ January 2019 ;

(b) $20 \%$, for the financial year beginning on or after $1^{\text {St }}$ January 2020;

(c) $30 \%$, for the financial year beginning on or after $1^{\text {St }}$ January 2021;

(d) $40 \%$ for the financial year beginning on or after $1^{\text {st }}$ January 2022 ;

(e) $50 \%$ for the financial year beginning on or after $1^{\text {st }}$ January 2023;

(f) $60 \%$ for the financial year beginning on or after $1^{\text {st }}$ January 2024 ;

(g) $70 \%$ for the financial year beginning on or after $1^{\text {st }}$ January 2025 ;

(h) $80 \%$ for the financial year beginning on or after $1^{\text {st }}$ January 2026 ;

(i) $90 \%$ for the financial year beginning on or after $1^{\text {st }}$ January 2027 ;

(j) $100 \%$ for the financial year beginning on or after $1^{\text {st }}$ January 2028 .'

D1.3 This formula utilises the square root rule to aggregate the various risks under the assumption that the risks are at least partially independent of one another and, therefore, some diversification benefit is provided when combining the risk charges. The end result is the BSCR (after covariance adjustment).

D1.4 The operational risk capital charge is the operational risk charge multiplied by the BSCR (after covariance adjustment). The risk charge ranges from $1 \%$ to $10 \%$ based on each insurer's self-assessment of the CIRA framework.

D1.5 Capital add-ons/reductions may be assessed where the BMA believes that an insurer's risk profile deviates significantly from the risk assumptions underlying the ECR or from the insurer's assessment of its risk management policies and practices. These include, but are not limited to, items such as provisions for reserve deficiencies, significant growth in premiums and quality of risk management surrounding operational risk.

D1.6 The BSCR is equal to the sum of the BSCR (after covariance adjustment), operational risk capital charge and capital add-ons/reductions (if assessed).

## Available Statutory Economic Capital and Surplus

D1.7 Available Statutory Economic Capital and Surplus is defined as the Total Statutory Economic Capital and Surplus of the insurer, including subsequent Capital Contribution less Capital Add-ons/Reductions (BMA assessment). All capital contributions are to be approved by the BMA, and all capital add-ons/reductions are determined at the discretion of the BMA.

D1.8 The insurer's available statutory economic capital and surplus is determined for purposes of calculating the BSCR and ECR ratios.

## Minimum Margin of Solvency

D1.9 The MSM is prescribed by the IAR.

## ECR and TCL

D1.10 The ECR is the higher of the MSM and the BSCR/approved internal capital model.

D1.11 The TCL is equal to $120 \%$ of the ECR.

## Ratios

D1.12 The BSCR Ratio is the ratio of the Available Statutory Economic Capital and Surplus to the BSCR.

D1.13 The ECR Ratio is the ratio of the Available Statutory Economic Capital and Surplus to the ECR.

## Solvency Capital Distribution Chart

D1.14 The Solvency Capital Distribution chart displays the relative contribution of each charge to the BSCR, prior to the covariance adjustment.

## Regulatory Action Level Graph

D1.15 The Regulatory Action Level graph displays the insurer's Available Statutory Economic Capital and Surplus position relative to the BMA's regulatory action guidelines, where Regulatory Action Level 1 is equal to the insurer's ECR and Regulatory Action Level 2 is equal to the insurer's TCL.

D4.1 The interest rate/liquidity risk represents the economic risk an insurer is subjected to due to changes in interest rates. The charge is calculated by applying the 'shock' of a $2 \%$ increase in interest rates to the portion of the insurer's assets (proportionate to the percentage of reserves) related to the duration difference. These assets include quoted and unquoted bonds and debentures - other, quoted and unquoted preferred stocks, and mortgage loans.

D4.2 The interest rate/liquidity risk calculation takes into account known and unknown assetliability duration mismatches. For known differences in duration mismatches, a set of asset-liability management questions have to be answered ('Interest Rate / Liquidity Risk' tab in the model) in order to arrive at a discount factor. The discount factor is applied on the interest rate / liquidity risk capital requirement: the higher the quality of the insurer's Asset-Liability Management (ALM) policies and procedures, the higher the discount factor (referred to as 'ALM credit'), the lower the capital requirement. The insurer can receive up to $50 \%$ credit based on the quality of its ALM practices.

## Interest Rate/Liquidity Risk Capital Charge

D4.3 The interest rate/liquidity risk charge calculation can be summarised by the following formula:

C (duration $1 \times$ rateshock $\times$ reserveshare $\times$ assets $\times 100 \%-$

$(\text { ALMCredit })_{\text {LTint }}+($ duration $2 \times$ rateshock $\times(1-$ reserveshare $) \times$ assets $)$, where

assets = quoted and unquoted value of total bonds and debentures, preferred stock, or mortgage loans;

duration $1=$ duration that applies for business where the duration of assets and liabilities is known;

rateshock = assumed interest rate shock prescribed by the BMA;

duration2 $=$ applies for business where the duration of assets and liabilities is not known. duration2 is equal to 2;

AMLCredit = the ALM credit based on the quality of an insurer's practices; and reserveshare $=$ the amount of reserves with known duration divided by the total reserves. The statement source for reserveshare is Schedule V paragraph (h) of these Rules.

## Items

D4.4 Asset Values - These include the quoted and unquoted values of bonds and debentures, preferred stocks and mortgage loans.

D4.5 Assumed interest shock - The BMA prescribed this as 200 basis points.

D4.6 Duration that applies for business where the duration of assets and liabilities is known This duration is the higher of:
a) 1 ; or

b) The insurer's weighted average of the difference in asset duration and liability duration.

The statement source for the weighted average of the difference in asset duration and liability duration is Schedule V paragraph (f) of the Rules.

Duration that applies for business where the duration of assets and liabilities is not known

- This duration is equal to 2 .

D4.7 The amount of reserves with known duration to total reserves - The statement source for the amount of reserves with known duration divided by the total reserves is Schedule V paragraph (g) of the Prudential Standard Rules.

D4.8 ALM Credit - Based on the insurer's responses to its asset-liability management policies, an insurer can receive up to $50 \%$ credit on its interest rate/liquidity risk capital charge where the duration mismatch is known. The insurer answers the initial question 'Has the insurer implemented policies on Asset-Liability Management, including tolerances for deviation?' If the answer is 'no', the insurer does not have to complete the remaining five questions and no ALM credit is granted. If the answer is 'yes', answers to the following questions will determine the total discount credit available to the insurer. The higher the quality of the insurer's policies and procedures, the higher the discount factor the insurer gets.

## Instructions Affecting Interest Rate/Liquidity Risk

a) All assets comprising of total bonds and debentures, preferred stock, and mortgage loans investments that are subject to capital charges within the interest rate/liquidity risk charge shall be included;

b) All quoted and unquoted non-affiliated other bond and debentures and preferred stock shall be included in the interest rate/liquidity risk charge; and

c) Total bonds and debentures, preferred stock, and mortgage loans investments shall be reported on a basis consistent with that used for purposes of statutory financial reporting; and

d) Amounts are to be reported on a consolidated EBS basis.

## D5. CURRENCY RISK

## Background

D5.1 The currency risk charge is based on amounts reported on Form 4EBS total assets and liabilities. It represents the risk that the net asset position of an insurer may worsen as a result of exchange rate changes if assets and liabilities are not currency matched. Insurers are to include at least $95 \%$ of their total assets and liabilities based on the predefined five currency types (USD, Euro, GBP, Canadian Dollar and Japanese Yen) and ten other currency types.

D5.2 The charge is first calculated by determining the assessment charge which is based on the greater of:

a) The prior year ECR charge to the prior year total EBS liabilities reported and

b) The average of the last three prior years' ECR charge to last three prior years total EBS liabilities reported.

D5.3 The currency risk capital charge is applied based on the asset held for each currency type less the liabilities and the proxy BSCR (proxy BSCR is determined by applying the assessment charge to the currency type's liabilities). In instances there is a currency type that has insufficient assets held to the liabilities and proxy BSCR, a 25\% capital charge is applied to the difference, if there are sufficient assets held to the liabilities and proxy BSCR, then there is no/NIL capital charge applied.

## Currency Risk Capital Charge

D5.4 The currency risk charge calculation can be summarised by the following formula:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& C_{\text {Curr }}=\sum_{i} \chi_{i} \times\left(\text { Currproxybscr }_{i}+\text { Currliab }_{i}-\text { Currast }_{i}\right), \quad \text { where } \\
& \chi_{i}=25 \% \text { where } \text { Currast }_{i-} \text { Currliab }_{i-)} \text { Currproxybscr }_{i} 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Currency $_{i} \quad=$ refers to currency type that has been translated to the functional currency as expressed in Form 4EBS

GrossCurrast $_{i} \quad=$ value of assets corresponding to Currency Cus reported on Form $_{i}$ 4EBS line 15

Currast $_{i} \quad=$ value of assets corresponding to Currency Cus report on Form $_{i}$ 4EBS line 15 adjusted to allow for currency hedging arrangements

GrossCurrliab $_{i} \quad=$ value of liabilities corresponding to Currency Cus $_{i}$ as reported on Form 4EBS line 39.

Currliab $_{i} \quad=$ value of liabilities corresponding to Currency ${ }_{i}$ as reported on Form 4EBS line 39 adjusted to allow for currency hedging arrangements

Currproxybscr $_{i} \quad=$ refers to the product of GrossCurrlia $_{i}$ and BSCR Proxy factor; and

BSCR Pr o xyfactors = greater of:

a)The Enhanced Capital Requirement divided by Form 4EBS line 39 Total Liabilities for the preceding year;

b) the average of the above ratio for the preceding three years.

Where there are no prior submissions available, the BSCR proxy factor is the above ratio that would be obtained from the current submission without taking into account the currency risk charge.

## Items

D5.5 EBS Assets by Currency Types - Based on current year Form 4 EBS line 15; 95\% of total EBS assets by type of currency.

D5.6 EBS Liabilities by Currency Types - Based on current year Form 4 EBS line 39; 95\% of total EBS liabilities by type of currency.

D5.7 Total ECR Requirement- Based on three prior years ECR Requirement.

D5.8 Total EBS Liabilities- Based on three prior years Form 4 EBS line 39; total EBS liabilities (note if the EBS liabilities for the preceding three years is not available, provide the statutory liability as reported on line 39).

## Instructions Affecting Currency Risk

a) Where the insurer uses currency hedging arrangements to manage its currency risk, then Currast $_{i}$ and Currliab $_{i}$ may reflect the impact of those arrangements on GrossCurrast $_{i}$ and GrossCurrliab $i$ of a $25 \%$ adverse movement in foreign exchange currency rates, otherwise the amounts GrossCurrast $_{i}$ and GrossCurrliab $_{i}$ shall apply;

b) Any adjustment to reflect currency hedging arrangements shall not apply to the calculation of Currproxybscr ; $_{i}$;

c) 'Currency hedging arrangements' means derivative or other risk mitigation arrangements designed to reduce losses due to foreign currency exchange movements, and which meet the Authority's requirements to be classed as such;

d) Insurers are to report currencies representing at least 95\% of their economic balance sheet liabilities; and

e) Amounts are to be reported on a consolidated EBS basis.

## D6. CONCENTRATION RISK

## Background

D6.1 The concentration risk charge is based on asset counterparty exposures as reported on the Form 4EBS. It represents the risk of losses due to asset concentrations.

D6.2 The charge is calculated by aggregating all the Asset Type, Bond/Mortgage Loan Type (if applicable), BSCR Rating (if applicable) and Asset Value together and assigning the values to the respective fixed income, equity, credit capital factor charge.

## Concentration Risk Capital Charge

D6.3 The concentration risk charge calculation can be summarised by the following formula:

$C_{\text {Conc }}=\sum_{i} \chi_{i} \times$ Concastclass $_{i} \quad$ where

$\chi_{i} \quad=$ the capital charge factors supplied by the BMA for each type Concastclass $_{i}$ of and

Concastclass $_{i}=$ value of corresponding asset in Asset Class.

## D8. INSURANCE RISK - MORTALITY

## Background

D8.1 Insurance products that are considered to be exposed to mortality risk include term assurance, whole life, universal life, and accidental death and dismemberment insurance. These exclude life policies with critical illness acceleration riders.

D8.2 The insurance risk-mortality charge is calculated by applying a capital factor to the respective net amount at risk. The capital risk factors are applied on an additive basis (i.e. 3.97/1000 on first $\$ 1$ billion of business, plus 1.80/1000 on the next $\$ 4$ billion of business, etc.).

D8.3 A 50\% reduction is applied to adjustable products and accidental death products. Adjustable products are defined as any insurance contracts in which the insurer has the ability to make a material adjustment to the premiums/cost of insurance charges/dividends, based on recent experience.

## Insurance Risk - Mortality Capital Charge

D8.4 The insurance risk - mortality charge calculation can be summarised by the following formula:

$$
C_{\text {LTmort }}=\left[\sum_{i} \alpha 1_{i} \times N A A R 1_{i}\right]+\left[\sum_{i} \alpha 2_{i} \times N A A R 2_{i}\right] \text {, where }
$$

$\alpha 1_{i} \quad=$ capital charge factor for adjustable mortality long-term business;

$N A A R 1_{i}=$ the net amount at risk of all adjustable mortality long-term business;

$\alpha 2_{i} \quad=$ capital charge factor for non-adjustable mortality long-term business; and

Items

$N A A R 2_{i}=$ the net amount at risk of all non-adjustable mortality long-term business.

## D11. INSURANCE RISK - MORBIDITY AND DISABILITY

## Background

D11.1 Morbidity and disability risks are separated by critical illness insurance products and health insurance products.

D11.2 For critical illness insurance products, including accelerated critical illness insurance products, a prescribed capital factor is applied to the net amount at risk, on an additive basis. A 50\% reduction in the capital risk factors is applied to adjustable products.

D11.3 Health insurance products include disability income products, long-term care insurance products, waiver of premium benefits, and other accidental and sickness products.

## Insurance Risk - Morbidity and Disability Capital Charge

D11.4 The insurance risk - morbidity and disability charge calculation can be summarised by the following formula:

## D14. VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEE RISK

## Background

D14.1 Variable annuity benefits are partitioned into five categories:

a) Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit (GMAB);

b) Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit (GMDB),

c) Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit (GMIB),

d) Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB), and

e) Guaranteed Enhanced Earnings Benefit (GEEB). Variable annuities contain various minimum guarantees that expose insurers to risks of a particularly volatile nature.

D14.2 The capital risk factors differentiate by volatility levels and are applied to the et Amount at Risk (NAR). Volatility is defined as the annual historic volatility of the fund. In the case where there is no or limited, history of the fund, use the volatility of the benchmark. Where the Guarantee Value (GV) is less than the Account Value (AV), the minimum floor factors are applied to the account values. The proportion used for the AV under reinsurance is the proportion used for net amount at risk.

D14.3 Net amount at risk (net of reinsurance) is defined as follows:

a) GMAB - total claim payable if all contracts mature immediately;

b) GMDB - total claim amount payable upon immediate death of all policyholders;

c) GMIB - total claim payable upon full and immediate annuitisation of all policies using an $80 \%$ factor applied to the GV (the $80 \%$ represents the ratio between current market annuitisation factors and the guaranteed annuitisation factors);

d) GMWB - total claim payable if $100 \%$ of the guaranteed withdrawal benefit base in excess of the current AV is withdrawn immediately; and

e) GEEB - total guaranteed enhanced payments upon immediate death of all policyholders.

## Variable Annuity Guarantee Capital Charge

D14.4 The variable annuity guarantee risk charge calculation can be summarised by the following formula:

$C_{\text {LTVA }}=$ either $\left(\sum_{i}\right.$ TotalBSReq $_{i}-$ TotalBAR TotalGMB $\left._{\text {adj }}\right)$ or $\left(\right.$ IMCReq $\left._{\text {LTVA }}\right)$ wherein -

TotalBS Re $q_{i}=$ higher of (a) $\left(\alpha 1_{i} \times G V 1_{i}+\alpha 2_{i} \times G V 2_{i}+\alpha 3_{i} \times G V 3_{i}\right)$ and (b) $\left(\alpha 4_{i} \times N A R 1_{i}+\alpha 5_{i} \times N A R 2_{i}+\alpha 6_{i} \times N A R 3_{i}\right) ;$

a) TotalBAR = the total BSCR adjusted reserves for variable annuity guarantee risk;

b) TotalGMDB ${ }_{\text {adj }}=$ capital requirement charged on Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit (GMDB) policies multiplied by the percentage of GMDB with multiple guarantees;

c) IMCRe $q_{\text {LTVA }}=$ the capital requirement for variable annuity guarantee risk determined in accordance with an insurance group's internal capital model, if applicable;
d) $G V 1_{i}, G V 2_{i}, G V 3_{i}, N A R 1_{i}, N A R 2_{i}$, and $N A R 3_{i}$ are the guaranteed value and net amount at risk under each range of volatility for each specified variable annuity product risk; and
e) $\alpha 1_{i}, \alpha 2_{i}, \alpha 3_{i}, \alpha 4_{i}, \alpha 5_{i}$ and $\alpha 6_{i}$ are the capital factors applied to the guaranteed value and net amount at risk under each range of volatility for each specified variable annuity product risk.

## D15. CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT

## Background

D15.1 The capital adjustment charge represents the capital requirements for regulated noninsurance financial operating entities and shall comprise the capital adjustment, which is added to the BSCR (after covariance adjustment) to arrive at the BSCR. The BSCR will be used to determine an insurer's ECR for the relevant year, as reported in the Summary section of the BSCR model.

## Capital adjustment

The capital adjustment charge calculation can be summarised by the following formula:

$\mathrm{C}_{\text {adj }}=$ Regulatory capital requirement for regulated non-insurance financial operating entities.

## Items

D15.2 Regulatory capital requirement for regulated non-insurance financial operating entities This capital adjustment charge shall be determined in accordance with Schedule XVI, where this amount shall be equal to the sum of the insurer's proportionate share of each registered entity's regulatory capital in accordance with the applicable solvency rules of the jurisdiction where the entity was licensed or registered.

D16.2 The BSCR is determined on an economic balance sheet (EBS) valuation basis according to the following formula:

$B S C R_{\text {Corr }}=$ Basic BSCR $+C_{\text {operational }}+C_{\text {regulatoryadj }}+C_{\text {otheradj }}+C_{\text {AdjTP }}$

Where:

| Basic BSCR | = basic BSCR risk module charge; |
| :---: | :---: |

D16.6 This formula utilises the correlation matrix to aggregate the various risks under the assumption that the risks are not independent with one another, and therefore, provides a linear diversification benefit when combining the risk charges. The end result is the BSCR (after correlation adjustment).

D16.7 The operational risk capital charge is the operational risk charge multiplied by the sum of (gross) BSCR (after correlation adjustment) and the adjustment for loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions according to paragraph D30.4. The risk charge ranges from $1 \%$ to $20 \%$ based on each insurer's self-assessment of the CIRA framework.

D16.8 Capital add-ons/reductions may be assessed where the BMA believes that an insurer's risk profile deviates significantly from the risk assumptions underlying the ECR or from the insurer's assessment of its risk management policies and practices. These include, but are not limited to, items such as: provisions for reserve deficiencies, significant growth in premiums, and quality of risk management surrounding operational risk.

D16.9 The BSCR is equal to the sum of the BSCR (after correlation adjustment), operational risk capital charge, capital add-ons/reductions (if assessed), adjustment for lossabsorbing capacity of technical provisions and adjustment for loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes.

## Available Statutory Economic Capital and Surplus

D16.10 Available Statutory Economic Capital and Surplus is defined as the Total Statutory Economic Capital and Surplus of the insurer, including subsequent Capital Contribution less Capital Add-ons/Reductions (BMA assessment). All capital contributions are to be approved by the BMA, and all capital add-ons/reductions are determined at the discretion of the BMA.

D16.11 The insurer's available statutory economic capital and surplus is determined for purposes of calculating the BSCR and ECR ratios.

## Minimum Margin of Solvency

D16.12 The MSM is prescribed by the Insurance Account Rules 2016 ('IAR').

## ECR and TCL

D16.13 The ECR is the higher of the MSM and the BSCR/approved internal capital model.

D16.14 The TCL is equal to $120 \%$ of the ECR.

## Ratios

D16.15 The BSCR Ratio is the ratio of the Available Statutory Economic Capital and Surplus to the BSCR.

D16.16 The ECR Ratio is the ratio of the Available Statutory Economic Capital and Surplus to the ECR.

## Solvency Capital Distribution Chart

D16.17 The Solvency Capital Distribution chart displays the relative contribution of each charge to the BSCR, prior to the correlation adjustment.

## Regulatory Action Level Graph

D16.18 The Regulatory Action Level graph displays the insurer's Available Statutory Capital and Surplus position relative to the BMA's regulatory action guidelines, where Regulatory Action Level 1 is equal to the insurer's ECR and Regulatory Action Level 2 is equal to the insurer's TCL.

D18. EQUITY INVESTMENT RISK

## Background

D18.1 There are various categories of equity investments comprising common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate and other miscellaneous investments that are used to determine the Equity Investment Risk capital charge. All non-affiliated stocks held by the insurer should be reported, including both quoted and unquoted issues.

## Equity Investment Risk Capital Charge

D18.2 The equity investment risk charge calculation can be summarised by the following formula:

$$
C_{\text {equity }}=\sqrt{C_{\text {equity }}^{\text {basic }}+C_{\text {equity }}^{\text {grandfathered }}}
$$

where

$$
C_{\text {equity }}=\sqrt{\sum_{i, j} \operatorname{Corr}^{2} q_{i, j} \times C_{i} \times C_{j}}
$$

$C_{\text {equity }}^{\text {grandfathered }}=$ the equity risk charge calculated according to section D3 for equity exposures

that are grandfathered according to paragraph D18A below

$\operatorname{Corr} E q_{i, j} \quad=$ the correlation factors of the equity risk correlation matrix in accordance with

Table 2A;

$i, j \quad=$ the sum of the different terms should cover all possible combinations of correlation $i$ and $j$;

$C_{i}$ and $C_{j} \quad=$ risk charge $\mathrm{i}$ and risk charge $\mathrm{j}$ which are replaced by the following:

$C_{\text {Type1 } 1}, C_{\text {Type2 }}, C_{\text {Type3 } 3}, C_{\text {Type4 }} ;$

$C_{\text {Type1 }} \quad=$ Type1 equity risk charge as calculated over the classes set out below;

$C_{\text {Type2 }} \quad=$ Type 2 equity risk charge as calculated over the classes set out below;

$C_{\text {Type3 }} \quad=$ Type3 equity risk charge as calculated over the classes set out below; and

$C_{\text {Type } 4} \quad=$ Type 4 equity risk charge as calculated over the classes set out below;

Table 2A - Equity Risk Charge Correlation Matrix

| Equity Corr <br> Matrix | $C_{\text {Type1 }}$ | $C_{\text {Type2 }}$ | $C_{\text {Type3 }}$ | $C_{\text {Type4 }}$ |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $C_{\text {Type1 }}$ | 1.00 |  |  |  |
| $C_{\text {Type2 }}$ | 0.75 | 1.00 |  |  |
| $C_{\text {Type3 }}$ | 0.75 | 0.75 | 1.00 |  |
| $C_{\text {Type4 }}$ | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.50 | 1.00 |

D18.3 Type1, Type2 Type3 and Type4 equity risk charges calculation shall be determined in accordance with the following formulas-

## Instructions Affecting Equity Investment Risk

a) All assets (except regulated non-insurance financial operating entities) and liabilities (except the risk margin) whose value is subject to equity risk shocks are to be reported on a basis consistent with that used for the purposes of economic balance sheet reporting. Such assets and liabilities shall include equity risk exposures determined by application of the 'look-through' approach calculated in accordance with criteria prescribed in section B6 for the following items:

(i) Collective investment vehicles and other investments packaged as funds, including related undertakings used as investment vehicles;

(ii) Segregated accounts assets and liabilities;

(iii) Deposit asset and liabilities;

(iv) Assets and liabilities held by ceding insurers or under retrocession;

(v) Other sundry assets and liabilities; and

(vi)Derivatives.

b) For asset types referred to in paragraph (a) (i) to (vi) where the 'look-through' approach cannot be applied, the residual balance shall be included in 'Equity Securities - Other Investments';

c) Short exposures qualifying as assets held for risk-mitigation purposes and short exposures not qualifying as assets held for risk-mitigation purposes, shall both be determined in accordance with criteria prescribed in section B4; and

d) Amounts are to be reported on an EBS valuation basis.

D18A. The equity investments that are eligible to be used in the calculation of $C_{\text {equity }}^{\text {grandfathered }}$ as defined in section D18.2 are determined as follows:

(i) The average value of equities as a percentage of total assets over the prior three financial year ends before 1 January 2019 (i.e., over the financial years ending 2016 to 2018) is calculated.

1) Similarly, for each class of equities in accordance with Table $2 \mathrm{~B}$, the average amounts as a percentage of total equities shall be determined over the same prior three years, (i.e. the allocations for each equity class).

(ii) The total amount of equities eligible to be used in the calculation of $C_{\text {equity }}^{\text {grandfathered }}$ as defined in section D18.2 at each year end is determined by multiplying the amount of legacy reserves by the equity percentage of paragraph (i)., where

1) 'Legacy reserves' are defined as the long term best estimate labilities, at the applicable point in time (financial year-end), for insurance business carried on as at 31 December 2018.
2) The total amount of equities eligible to be used in the calculation of $C_{\text {equity }}^{\text {grandfathered }}$ as defined in section D18.2 at each year-end shall not be greater than the amount of the legacy reserves.

(iii)The equity investments eligible to be used in the calculation of $C_{\text {equity }}^{\text {grandfathered }}$ as defined in section D18.2 per equity class are calculated by multiplying the total amount in paragraph (ii). by the equity class allocation in paragraph (i).

(iv) Future applicable reserves shall be capped at the initial reserve. The amount of equities eligible to be used in the calculation of $C_{\text {equity }}^{\text {grandfathered }}$ as defined in section D18.2 can therefore never be greater than the initial amount.

(v) Equities that are eligible to be used being used in the calculation of $C_{\text {equity }}^{\text {grandfathered }}$ as defined in section D18.2 may be traded or replaced within a specific equity class and still receive the aforementioned treatment.

## Instructions - Equity Grandfathering in the BSCR Model

D18.4 Insurers that do not use equity grandfathering are required to calculate equity risk both on the old BSCR basis and the new BSCR basis; both calculations are required for the transitional functionality. (If an insurer opts to transition immediately to the new BSCR basis and receives the Authority's approval, calculation on the old basis is not needed; in this case the BSCR model needs to be modified to eliminate the transitional calculation in the Summary tab.)

D18.5 Those insurers that decide to use equity grandfathering for their eligible long-term business are required to calculate the equity risk with grandfathering (the 'grandfathered equity risk') in addition to the two calculations above (i.e., pure old and pure new basis), for a total of three separate equity risk calculations. In the calculation of the grandfathered equity risk, part of the equity investments (the grandfathered part) are allocated to the old equity risk calculation, and the remaining part of the equity investments (the non-grandfathered part) are allocated to the new equity risk calculation.

D18.6 Since the implementation of the grandfathered equity risk calculation requires both the old equity risk tab and the new equity risk tab, in order to be able to determine all three equity risk amounts - old basis, new basis, grandfathered - at the same time in one BSCR model, two copies of both the old and the new equity risk calculation are required. To this end, two additional tabs are introduced to calculate the grandfathered equity risk amount, together with the required supporting schedules that feed the input data into the equity risk calculation tabs.

D18.7 In practical terms, the process is as follows:

a) To calculate the equity risk charge on the old BSCR basis, all the equity investments are to be allocated to the 'Equity Investments' tab (through filling the appropriate schedules), as if the old rules applied.

b) To calculate the equity risk charge on the new BSCR basis, all the equity investments are to be allocated to the 'Equity Investments (Revised)' tab (through filling the appropriate schedules), as if the new rules applied.

c) To calculate the grandfathered equity risk charge on the new basis,
(i) The amount of equity investments eligible for grandfathering, per each equity class, is determined using the helper tab 'Equity Grandfathering'; by extension, this determines the amounts of equity investments, per each class, that are not eligible for grandfathering as the difference between the total investment amounts and the grandfathered amounts.

(ii) Those (and only those) equity investments that are eligible for grandfathering are to be allocated to the 'Equity Investments (Grandf)' tab, as if the old rules applied.

1) This is done by filling in the helper schedule 'Grandfathered Equity Part' with the grandfathered equity investments.

(iii)The remaining (non-grandfathered) equity investments are to be allocated to the 'Equity Investments (Non-Grandf)' tab following the new rules.

1) This is done by filling in the helper schedule 'Non-Grandfathered Equity Part' with the non-grandfathered equity investments.

D18.8 Although the pure new basis equity risk capital requirement (in subparagraph B above) is not directly used in determining the BSCR for insurers using equity grandfathering, it is required as additional information. This is to assess the effect of equity grandfathering and the capital position the insurer would have without it. The Authority expects the insurers to calculate the capital requirements without grandfathering for their own risk management purposes as well.

D19. INTEREST RATE AND LIQUIDITY RISK

## Background

D19.1 The interest rate and liquidity risk charge calculation may be calculated based on the instructions D19.2-D19.9 (option 1) or based on the instructions D19.10-D19.15 (option 2). Once the insurer chooses to use option 2 , the insurer cannot move back to using option 1 without the prior written approval of the Authority.

## Interest Rate/Liquidity Risk Capital Charge Option 1

D19.2 The interest rate/liquidity risk represents the economic risk an insurer is subjected to due to changes in interest rates. The charge is calculated by applying the 'shock' of a $2 \%$ increase in interest rates to the portion of the insurer's assets (proportionate to the percentage of reserves) related to the duration difference. These assets include quoted and unquoted bonds and debentures - other, quoted and unquoted preferred stocks, and mortgage loans.

D19.3 The interest rate/liquidity risk calculation takes into account known and unknown assetliability duration mismatches. For known differences in duration mismatches, a set of asset-liability management questions have to be answered ('Interest Rate/Liquidity Risk' tab in the model) in order to arrive at a discount factor. The discount factor is applied on the interest rate / liquidity risk capital requirement: the higher the quality of the insurer's asset-liability management policies and procedures, the higher the discount factor (referred to as 'ALM credit'), the lower the capital requirement. The insurer can receive up to $50 \%$ credit based on the quality of its asset-liability management practices.

## Interest Rate/Liquidity Risk Capital Charge Option 1

D19.4 The interest rate/liquidity risk charge calculation can be summarised by the following formula:

C(duration $1 \times$ rateshock $\times$ reserveshare $\times$ assets $\times 100 \%-$ ALMCredit $)_{\text {LTint }}+($ duration $2 \times$

rateshock $\times(1-$ reserveshare $) \times$ assets $), \quad$ where

assets = quoted and unquoted value of total bonds and debentures, preferred stock, or mortgage loans;

duration 1 = duration that applies for business where the duration of assets and liabilities is known;

rateshock $=$ assumed interest rate shock prescribed by the BMA;

duration $2=$ the amount of reserves with known duration divided by the total reserves;

$A M L *$ Credit $=$ the ALM credit based on the quality of an insurer's practices; and reserveshare $=$ the amount of reserves with known duration divided by the total reserves. The statement source for reserveshare is Schedule V paragraph (h) of these Rules.

## Items

D19.5 Asset Values - These include the quoted and unquoted values of bonds and debentures, preferred stocks and mortgage loans.

D19.6 Assumed interest shock - The BMA prescribed this as 200 basis points.

D19.7 Duration that applies for business where the duration of assets and liabilities is known This duration is the higher of:
a) 1 ; or

b) The insurer's weighted average of the difference in asset duration and liability duration.

The statement source for the weighted average of the difference in asset duration and liability duration is Schedule V paragraph (f) of the Rules.

Duration that applies for business where the duration of assets and liabilities is not known

- This duration is equal to 2.

D19.8 The amount of reserves with known duration to total reserves - The statement source for the amount of reserves with known duration divided by the total reserves is Schedule V paragraph (g) of the Prudential Standard Rules.

D19.9 ALM Credit-Based on the insurer's responses to its asset-liability management policies, an insurer can receive up to $50 \%$ credit on its interest rate/liquidity risk capital charge where the duration mismatch is known. The insurer answers the initial question 'Has the insurer implemented policies on Asset-Liability Management, including tolerances for deviation?' If the answer is 'no', the insurer does not have to complete the remaining five questions and no ALM credit is granted. If the answer is 'yes', answers to the following questions will determine the total discount credit available to the insurer. The higher the quality of the insurer's policies and procedures, the higher the discount factor the insurer gets.

## Instructions Affecting Interest Rate and Liquidity Risk

a) All assets comprising of total bonds and debentures, preferred stock and mortgage loans investments that are subject to capital charges within the interest rate/liquidity risk charge shall be included;

b) All quoted and unquoted non-affiliated other bonds and debentures and preferred stock shall be included in the interest rate/liquidity risk charge; and

c) All other bonds and debentures, preferred stock and mortgage loans investments shall be reported on a basis consistent with that used for purposes described in the Prudential Standard Rules Schedule XIV and the guidance note for the statutory reporting regime.

## Interest Rate and Liquidity Risk Capital Charge Option 2

D19.10 The interest rate and liquidity risk option 2 charge calculation can be summarised by the following formula:

$$
C_{\text {Interest }}=\max \left\{\max \left(\operatorname{Shock}_{I R, D o w n}, \operatorname{Shock}_{I R, U p}\right)-\text { OffSet }_{\text {ScenarioBased }}, 0\right\}
$$

## D20. CURRENCY RISK

## Background

D20.1 The currency risk charge is based on amounts reported on Form 4EBS total assets and liabilities. It represents the risk that the net asset position of an insurer may worsen as a result of exchange rate changes if assets and liabilities are not currency matched. Insurers are to include at least $95 \%$ of their total assets and liabilities based on the predefined thirteen currency types (United States Dollar, Bermuda Dollar, Qatar Riyal, Hong Kong Dollar, Euro, Denmark Kroner, Bulgaria Leva, West African CFA Franc, Central African CFA Franc, Comorian Francs United Kingdom Pounds, Canadian Dollar and Japanese Yen) and ten other currency types.

D20.2 The currency risk capital charge is based on the assets held for each currency type and the liabilities and the proxy BSCR (proxy BSCR is determined by applying the proxy BSCR factor of D20.3 to the currency type's liabilities). In instances there is a currency type that has insufficient assets held to the liabilities and proxy BSCR, a shock is applied to both the assets and liabilities and the allocated capital requirement. The shock is a downwards shock to the reporting currency, meaning that the reporting currency will depreciate relative to other currencies. If there are sufficient assets held to the liabilities and proxy BSCR, then there is no/NIL capital charge applied.

D20.3 The proxy BSCR factor is determined as the greater of:

a. The prior year ECR charge to the prior year total EBS liabilities reported and

b. The average of the last three prior years ECR charge to last three prior years total EBS liabilities reported.

## Currency Risk Capital Charge

D20.4 The currency risk charge calculation can be summarised by the following formula:

$$
\left.C_{\text {Currency }}=\sum_{i} \max \left\{\left[\begin{array}{c}
\left(M V A_{i, \text { Before }}-M V A_{i, \text { After }}\left(\chi_{i}\right)\right)+\left(M V D L_{i, \text { Before }}^{Q}-M V D L_{i, \text { After }}^{Q}\left(\chi_{i}\right)\right)+\cdots \\

+\max \left(M V D S_{i, B \text { Befe }}^{N Q}-M V D S_{i, A f t e r}^{N Q}\left(\chi_{i}\right), 0\right)-\left(M V L_{i, \text { Before }}-M V L_{i, \text { After }}\left(\chi_{i}\right)\right)+\cdots \\

## D21. CONCENTRATION RISK

## Background

D21.1 The concentration risk charge is based on asset counterparty exposures as reported on the Form 4EBS. It represents the risk of losses due to asset concentrations.

D21.2 The charge is calculated by aggregating all the Asset Type, Bond / Mortgage Loan Type (if applicable), BSCR Rating (if applicable) and Asset Value together and assigning the values to the respective fixed income, equity, credit capital factor charge.

## Concentration Risk Capital Charge

D21.3 The concentration risk charge calculation can be summarised by the following formula:

$$
C_{\text {Concentration }}=\sum_{i} \chi_{i} \times \text { Concastclass }_{i} \quad \text { where }
$$

$\chi_{i}=$ the capital charge factors supplied by BMA for each type Concastclass $_{i}$ of and

Concastclass $_{i}=$ value of corresponding asset in Asset Class.

## Instructions Affecting Concentration Risk

a) Concastclas $s_{i}$ shall only apply to an insurers' ten largest counterparty exposures based on the aggregate of all assets relating to that counterparty;

b) A counterparty exposure shall be reported on the valuation of individually underlying assets (i.e., determined by application of the 'look-through' approach), (as described in B6) for all amounts reported on the balance sheet;

c) A counterparty shall include all related or connected counterparties captured by either of the following criteria:

(i) Controller relationship: if a counterparty, directly or indirectly, has control of (as a result of its majority shareholding or effective management) which it is a subsidiary company; or

(ii) Economic interdependence: if one of the counterparties were to experience financial difficulties which directly or indirectly affect the ability of any or all of the remaining counterparties to perform their financial obligations (e.g., where a counterparty becomes unable to fund or repay certain financial contractual obligations, and as a result, other counterparties, are likely to be unable to fund or repay certain obligations imposed on them);

d) Amounts are to be reported on an EBS valuation basis.

## D22. CREDIT RISK

## Background

D22.1 Credit risks are partitioned into four categories: accounts and premiums receivable, all other receivables, particulars of reinsurance balances (current and future), and counterparty default risk for over-the-counter derivatives.

D22.2 Particulars of reinsurance balances is based on the greater of:

a) Current reinsurance balances receivable (as reported on Form 4EBS lines 11(e) Reinsurance Balances Receivable, 12(c) Funds Held by Ceding Reinsurers, which are not reported on Schedule IIA, and 17(c) Total Reinsurance Recoverable Balance); and

b) Future reinsurance balances receivable (as calculated on the Credit Risk Schedule).

This approach allows for new insurers that have not had claims and allows for a more reflective approach of reinsurance exposures in stressed circumstances.

D22.3 Where applicable, the amounts must reconcile to the appropriate line(s) of the insurer's Form 4EBS or to the schedules prescribed by or under the Prudential Standard Rules.

## Credit Risk Capital Charge

D22.4 The credit risk charge calculation can be summarised by the following formula:

$$
C_{\text {credit }}=\sum_{i} \delta_{i} \times \text { debtor }_{i} \times \mu_{r}+\text { CCROTC }
$$

$\delta_{i} \quad=$ BMA-supplied credit risk capital charge factor for type of debtor $_{i} ;$

| $\mu_{r}$ | $=$ <br> $=$ | additional diversification adjustment factor applied to reinsurance balances only <br> taking into consideration diversification by number of reinsurers, equal to $40 \%$. <br> counterparty default risk for over-the-counter derivatives calculated as per the <br> following formula: |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |

CCROTC following formula:

CCROTC $=$

$\sum_{i} \operatorname{Max}\left(0\right.$, MVDerivativeP $_{i}-\left(1-\beta_{i}\right) \operatorname{Min}\left(\right.$ MVderivative $_{i}$, MVCollateral $\left.\left._{i}\right)\right) \times \alpha_{i}$

MVDerivative $_{i}$

$=$ market value of over-the-counter derivatives with positive market values and BSCR rating $i$,

$\beta_{i} \quad=$ BMA-supplied collateral factor;

$\alpha_{i}$

MVCollateral

$=$ BMA-supplied capital factor for the BSCR rating $i$;

$=$ market value of collateral of over-the-counter derivatives with positive market values and BSCR rating $i$.

## D23. INSURANCE RISK - MORTALITY

D23.1 Insurance products that are considered to be exposed to mortality risk include term assurance, whole life, universal life, and accidental death and dismemberment insurance. These exclude life policies with critical illness acceleration riders.

D23.2 The insurance risk-mortality charge is calculated by applying a capital factor to the respective net amount at risk. The capital risk factors are applied on an additive basis (i.e. 3.97/1000 on first $\$ 1$ billion of business, plus 1.80/1000 on the next $\$ 4$ billion of business, etc.).

D23.3 A 50\% reduction is applied to adjustable products and accidental death products. Adjustable products are defined as any insurance contracts in which the insurer has the ability to make a material adjustment to the premiums / cost of insurance charges / dividends, based on recent experience.

D23.4 The insurance risk - mortality charge calculation can be summarised by the following formula:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \qquad C_{L T m o r t}=\left[\sum_{i} \alpha 1_{i} \times N A A R 1_{i}\right]+\left[\sum_{i} \alpha 2_{i} \times N A A R 2_{i}\right], \text { where } \\
& \alpha 1_{i}=\text { capital charge factor for adjustable mortality long-term business; } \\
& N A A R 1_{i}=\text { the net amount at risk of all adjustable mortality long-term business; } \\
& \alpha 2_{i}=\text { capital charge factor for non-adjustable mortality long-term business; } \\

D29. VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEE RISK

## Background

D29.1 Variable annuity benefits are partitioned into five categories:

a) Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit (GMAB);

b) Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit (GMDB),

c) Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit (GMIB),

d) Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB), and

e) Guaranteed Enhanced Earnings Benefit (GEEB). Variable annuities contain various minimum guarantees that expose insurers to risks of a particularly volatile nature.

D29.2 The capital risk factors differentiate by volatility levels and are applied to the Net Amount at Risk (NAR). Volatility is defined as the annual historic volatility of the fund. In the case where there is no, or limited, history of the fund, use the volatility of the benchmark. Where the Guarantee Value (GV) is less than the Account Value (AV), the minimum floor factors are applied to the account values. The proportion used for the AV under reinsurance is the proportion used for net amount at risk.

D29.3 Net amount at risk (net of reinsurance) is defined as follows:

a) GMAB - total claim payable if all contracts mature immediately;

b) GMDB - total claim amount payable upon immediate death of all policyholders;

c) GMIB - total claim payable upon full and immediate annuitisation of all policies using an $80 \%$ factor applied to the GV (the $80 \%$ represents the ratio between current market annuitisation factors and the guaranteed annuitisation factors);

d) GMWB - total claim payable if $100 \%$ of the guaranteed withdrawal benefit base in excess of the current AV is withdrawn immediately; and

e) GEEB - total guaranteed enhanced payments upon immediate death of all policyholders.

## Variable Annuity Guarantee Capital Charge

D29.4 The variable annuity guarantee risk charge calculation can be summarised by the following formula:

$C_{\text {LTVA }}=$ either $\left(\sum_{i}\right.$ TotalBSReq $_{i}-$ TotalBAR - TotalGMB $\left._{\text {adj }}\right)$ or $($ IMCReq LTVA $)$ wherein -

TotalBS Re $q_{i}=$ higher of (a) $\left(\alpha 1_{i} \times G V 1_{i}+\alpha 2_{i} \times G V 2_{i}+\alpha 3_{i} \times G V 3_{i}\right)$ and (b)
$\left(\alpha 4_{i} \times N A R 1_{i}+\alpha 5_{i} \times N A R 2_{i}+\alpha 6_{i} \times N A R 3_{i}\right)$
a) TotalBAR = the total BSCR adjusted reserves for variable annuity guarantee risk;

<img src="https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_18_bd6cd19252d07a322e1bg-218.jpg?height=59&width=1388&top_left_y=369&top_left_x=493" alt="image" style="width:100%;height:auto;">
Benefit (GMDB) policies multiplied by the percentage of GMDB with multiple guarantees;
c) $I M C \operatorname{Re} q_{L T V A}=$ the capital requirement for variable annuity guarantee risk determined in accordance with an insurance group's internal capital model, if applicable;
d) $G V 1_{i}, G V 2_{i}, G V 3_{i}, N A R 1_{i}, N A R 2_{i}$, and $N A R 3_{i}$ are the guaranteed value and net amount at risk under each range of volatility for each specified variable annuity product risk; and
e) $\alpha 1_{i}, \alpha 2_{i}, \alpha 3_{i}, \alpha 4_{i}, \alpha 5_{i}$ and $\alpha 6_{i}$ are the capital factors applied to the guaranteed value and net amount at risk under each range of volatility for each specified variable annuity product risk.

D30. CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT

## Background

D30.1 The capital adjustment charge represents

a) the capital requirements for regulated non-insurance financial operating entities and shall comprise the capital adjustment;

b) adjustment for loss absorbing capacity of technical provisions; and

c) adjustment for absorbing capital of deferred taxes

which is added to the BSCR (after correlation adjustment) to arrive at the BSCR. The BSCR will be used to determine an insurer's ECR for the relevant year, as reported in the Summary section of the BSCR model.

Capital adjustment - Non-Insurance Financial Operating Entities

D30.2 The capital adjustment charge calculation for regulated non-insurance financial operating entities can be summarised by the following formula:

$C_{\text {regulatoryadj }}=$ Regulatory capital requirement for regulated non-insurance financial operating entities.

## Items

D30.3 Regulatory capital requirement for regulated non-insurance financial operating entities this capital adjustment charge shall be determined in accordance with Schedule XVI, where this amount shall be equal to the sum of the insurer's proportionate share of each registered entity's regulatory capital in accordance with the applicable solvency rules of the jurisdiction where the entity was licensed or registered.

## Capital Adjustment - Management Actions

D30.4 The capital adjustment charge calculation for loss absorbing capacity of technical provisions due to management actions can be summarised by the following formula:

$$
A d j_{T P}=-\max (\min (\text { Basic BSCR }- \text { Basic } n B S C R, F D B), 0)
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Basic BSCR }=\sqrt{\sum_{i, j} \operatorname{CorrBBSCR}_{i, j} \times C_{i} \times C_{j}} \\
& \text { Basic nBSCR }=\sqrt{\sum_{i, j} \operatorname{CorrBBSCR}_{i, j} \times n C_{i} \times n C_{j}} \\
& \operatorname{CorrBBSCR}_{i, j}=\text { the correlation factors of the Basic BSCR correlation } \\
& \text { matrix as determined by Table A in section D16; } \\
& C_{i} \quad=\text { risk module charge } i \text { which are replaced by the following: } \\
& C_{\text {Market }}, C_{L T}, C_{\text {Credit }} ; \\
& =\quad \text { market risk module charge as determined by section D16.4; } \\
& C_{\text {Market }} \quad=\quad \text { Long-Term risk module charge as determined by section D16.5; } \\
& C_{L T} \quad \text { and }
\end{aligned}
$$

$=\quad$ credit risk module charge as determined by section D22.

$C_{\text {Credit }}$

$n C_{i} \quad=$ net risk module charge $i$ which is calculated the same way as $C_{i}$ but by allowing the future discretionary benefits to change and by allowing managements actions to be performed in accordance with the criteria prescribed in section B5 and which are replaced by the following:

$n C_{\text {Market }}, n C_{L T}, n C_{\text {Credit }}$;

$F D B \quad=$ net present value of future bonuses and other discretionary benefits.

## Capital adjustment - Deferred Taxes

D30.5 The capital adjustment charge calculation for loss absorbing capacity of deferred taxes can be summarised by the following formula:

$C_{\text {otheradj }}=\operatorname{Min}\left(\left(\left(\right.\right.\right.$ Basic BSCR $\left.+C_{\text {operational }}+C_{\text {regulatoryadj }}+A d j_{T P}\right) \times t$, Limit,$\left(\right.$ Basic BSCR $+C_{\text {operational }}+C_{\text {regulatoryadj }}+$ Adj $\left.\left._{T P}\right) \times 20 \%\right)$

Where -

Basic BSCR = Basic BSCR risk module charge as determined by section D16;

$C_{\text {operational }}=$ operational risk charge as determined by section D16.7;

$C_{\text {regulatoryadj }}=$ regulatory capital requirement for regulated non-insurance financial operating entities as determined by section D30.2;

$A d j_{T P}=$ adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions as determined by section D30.4;

$t=$ insurer's standard federal tax rate;

Limit $=$ PastLAC + CurrentLAC + FutureLAC;

PastLAC $=$ Loss Carryback Provision multiplied by $t$;

CurrentLAC $=$ Current Deferred Tax Liabilities minus Current Deferred Tax Assets; and

FutureLAC $=$ Risk Margin as reported on Form 4EBS line 27C multiplied by $t$;

[^0]:    1 "Guaranteed" benefits here refers to those contractual benefits that the insurer does not have the ability to change at its discretion. In particular, it is taken to mean all benefits other than future discretionary benefits.

    2 Where "baseline" level of management actions is assumed in calculating the best estimate liability for future discretionary benefits.

[^1]:    ${ }^{3}$ The overall significance of premium increases is, in any case, mitigated by the fact that if the insurer has the possibility to change premium at a certain point, then in most cases the cash flows after the said point will fall outside of the contract boundaries. Hence premium increases would only be relevant where the insurer does have an ability to change the premiums, but only in a very limited way.

[^2]:    ${ }^{4}$ In particular, this is true for all "delta-one assets", such as common stocks and funds, for which the application of an $\mathrm{x} \%$ downwards shock is equivalent to reducing the market value (price) by $\mathrm{x} \%$. 110

[^3]:    ${ }^{5}$ In particular, this is true for all assets whose value is not directly sensitive to exchange rate movements (i.e., whose local (foreign) currency value is independent of changes in exchange rates). For example, and assuming that USD is the reporting currency, although the value in dollars of a bond or common stock denominated in, say, Euros (EUR) will change as a result of a shock to USD/EUR exchange rate, the local currency value of the bond or common stock will not change as a result of the shock. For such assets the only change in value is the change in reporting currency terms, meaning that the percentage shock can be straightforwardly applied to the reporting currency value of the foreign currency position.

[^4]:    ${ }^{6}$ And segregated account company liabilities, deposit liabilities and sundry liabilities.

    7 Including segregated account company assets, deposit assets and sundry assets.
