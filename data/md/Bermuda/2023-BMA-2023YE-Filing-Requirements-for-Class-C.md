## Bermuda Long-Term Commercial Insurers

## Changes to the 2023 BSCR Model

Below are the changes from the 2022 to 2023 year-end model for Long-Term insurers:

1) For insurers that report under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 17, please complete Forms 1ASFS Statutory Balance Sheet, Form 2ASFS Statutory Statement of Income, and Form 8ASFS Statutory Statement of Capital and Surplus;
2) Schedule V(e) - Stress/Scenario Tests

a) Reporting basis has been amended for consolidated statutory basis to consolidated Economic Balance Sheet (EBS) basis;

b) Financial Market Scenario -

i. Updated rates for Stress Scenarios Tests R3, R4, R6, R7 and R8;

ii. R8 Inflation and Monetary Policy - table for input to each scenario type;

iii. R9 Long-Term Liquidity Stress Test Scenario - inclusion of updated stress scenario instructions.

c) Mortgage Loan Stress Test - requirement has been removed for Class C, D and E insurers.

3) Schedule VI - Schedule of Fixed Assets - has been updated based on industry feedback to clarify the reporting requirements and number of entry cells;
4) Schedule VIA - Schedule of Funds Held by Ceding Reinsurers - has been updated based on industry feedback to clarify the reporting requirements and number of entry cells;

## Additional Guidance

i) "Information Sheet" tab paragraph (e) Filing Period - ensure that the filing period start date has been completed and is correct. Note that this will affect the transition rate for the BSCR calculation;

ii) "Information Sheet" tab paragraph (g) Multiplier Exchange/Translation Rate to Bermuda Dollars - ensure that the exchange rate has been completed. Note for insurers that report in currencies other than the Bermuda Dollar or United States Dollar, that the exchange rate to report is the rate to convert the figures to Bermuda Dollar / United States Dollar. For insurers reporting in Bermuda Dollar or United States Dollar, enter 1.000.

For example, if an insurer reported in Canadian Dollars with an exchange rate of CAD to BDA of 0.7657 and BDA to CAD of 1.3060 .

the exchange rate to report in paragraph (g) would be 0.7657
iii) "Information Sheet" tab paragraph (m)(iv) - the Authority would like to advise that in relation to paragraph (m)(iv) a qualified opinion would not include qualifications for reporting its financial statements as condensed general purpose financial statements.
