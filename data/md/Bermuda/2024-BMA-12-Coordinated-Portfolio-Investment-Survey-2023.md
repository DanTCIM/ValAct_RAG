# Bermuda's Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) 
BMA, Financial Stability and Research Department, December 2024

Foreword

The Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) is a voluntary data collection exercise conducted annually under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The CPIS collects information about the cross-border holdings of portfolio investment securities in different economies. Portfolio investment is defined as cross-border transactions and positions involving debt or equity securities other than those in direct investment or reserve assets.

The CPIS data, published on the IMF website, is augmented with information from two other surveys, namely the Securities Held as Foreign Exchange Reserve (SEFER) and Securities Held by International Organisations (SSIO).

The IMF has conducted the CPIS since 1997, and over 80 countries have participated in the survey. Bermuda has participated in this exercise since 2001. Bermuda's numbers include data from the domestic and international sectors, and the size and relevance of the latter category make Bermuda an International Financial Centre (IFC).

This report, produced by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (Authority or BMA), covers Bermuda's CPIS results for 2023.

The Authority would like to sincerely thank all entities that participated in this year's survey.
We hope you will find the information in this report of interest.

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This study is part of the IMF's comprehensive international survey and measures Bermuda's foreign portfolio investment assets holdings. Foreign portfolio investment assets relate to tradable financial instruments, other than direct investments or reserve assets, issued by unrelated non-residents. ${ }^{1}$

Data for portfolio investment assets is separately requested for equity securities, investment fund shares and debt securities and is geographically allocated by the issuer's country of residence. The primary purpose of this study is to provide countries with estimates of their foreign portfolio assets at market value and to enhance the quality of statistics on global capital flow. All the data reflected in this report was as of 31 December 2023 unless otherwise stated.

In 2023, Bermuda's total assets totalled US\$1.96 trillion ${ }^{2,3}$, a marginal increase of $0.3 \%$ (US\$6.8 billion) over US\$1.95 trillion in 2022. At the same time, Bermuda's foreign portfolio investment assets remained over US\$1 trillion (US\$1,047 billion). However, this represents a decrease of 3.8\% (US\$41.6 billion) when compared to the value of holdings as of 31 December 2022. The decline was driven by a significant $17.2 \%$ decrease in the foreign portfolio holdings held by the investment funds sector. Bermuda's foreign portfolio holdings comprised approximately 53.4\% of total Bermuda's total financial services assets, down from 55.8\% in 2022.

The foreign portfolio holdings for Bermuda entities consist mainly of debt securities. As of 31 December 2023, Bermuda's holdings of foreign debt securities amounted to US\$840.0 billion, representing $80.2 \%$ of Bermuda's total foreign portfolio holdings. Debt securities comprised long-term debt securities, which accounted for 92.5\% (US\$777.0 billion) of total debt securities. Short-term debt securities amounted to US\$63.0 billion, accounting for $7.5 \%$ of total debt securities. Foreign equity holdings amounted to US\$207.0 billion, representing 19.8\% of Bermuda's total foreign portfolio holdings.

[^0]In terms of geographical distribution, holdings in the United States (US) dominated Bermuda's foreign portfolio investment assets. In 2023, the US accounted for 59.1\% (US\$618.6 billion) of the total holdings of Bermuda's foreign portfolio investment assets, an increase of 6.2\% (US\$36.1 billion) over 2022. This was followed by the Cayman Islands with a 4.9\% share and the United Kingdom (UK) with a 4.3\% share, while Canada, Hong Kong, Japan and Australia had shares of 4.1\%, 3.8\%, 2.3\% and $2.2 \%$, respectively. Other Countries accounted for the remaining 19.4\%.

In addition to the geographical breakdown, Bermuda's holders of foreign securities can be broken down into four subsectors: insurance ${ }^{4}$; investment funds, banks and the Government of Bermuda.

The insurance subsector has always dominated Bermuda's foreign portfolio holdings. As of 31 December 2023, it had an ownership share of 79.8\% (US\$835.0 billion). Insurance has been the largest subsector since 2001, when the survey was first conducted in Bermuda. This is consistent with the size and relevance of the insurance industry in Bermuda, a predominantly insurance-based IFC.

Investment funds were the second-largest subsector, accounting for 19.4\% (US\$203.4 billion) of foreign portfolio holdings, followed by banks, which accounted for $0.5 \%$ (US\$5.8 billion). The Government of Bermuda's foreign portfolio holdings amounted to US\$2.8 billion, which represented 0.3\% of Bermuda's total foreign portfolio holdings.

In 2023, the value of Bermuda's derived liabilities ${ }^{5}$ amounted to US\$523.5 billion, an increase of 2.3\% (US $\$ 12.0$ billion) over $2022^{6}$. Bermuda's derived liabilities consisted mainly of equity securities, which represent 80.1\% (US\$423.2 billion) of Bermuda's total derived liabilities. Geographically, Bermuda's derived liabilities were held primarily by US and Hong Kong residents, who had a 62.9\% share (the US 49.9\% and Hong Kong 13.1\%) as of 31 December 2023.

Global cross-border securities holdings have grown since the global financial crisis 2008, reaching its highest value of US $\$ 81.7$ trillion as of 31 December 2021. As of December 2023, global holdings totalled nearly US\$80.3 trillion, a significant increase of $14.4 \%$ (US\$10.1 trillion) compared to US\$70.2 trillion at the end of 2022.

[^1]With regards to other IFCs, the Cayman Islands reported a significant increase of 97.1\% in its foreign portfolio holdings over the previous year, while Ireland, Switzerland and Luxembourg also reported increases in their foreign portfolio holdings of $17.4 \%, 14.7 \%$ and $11.5 \%$, respectively. Malta reported a significant decrease of $70.0 \%$ in its foreign portfolio holdings year-over-year, and Guernsey also reported a $10.7 \%$ reduction.

When comparing derived liabilities to other IFCs, Singapore and Ireland reported significant year-over-year increases of $27.9 \%$ and 21.3\%, respectively. Luxembourg, Guernsey and Switzerland also reported increased derived liabilities of $9.9 \%, 8.9 \%$ and $7.3 \%$, respectively. Mauritius reported a decrease of $11.7 \%$ in its derived liabilities in 2023.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 What is the CPIS?

The CPIS is a voluntary data collection exercise conducted annually under the auspices of the IMF. Data is provided on holdings of cross-border portfolio investment securities issued by unrelated nonresidents. Data is separately requested for equity and investment fund shares, long-term and short-term debt instruments and geographically allocated by the economy (country) of residence of the issuer's economy (country) of residence.

### 2.2 Why does Bermuda participate?

Bermuda's participation in the CPIS contributes to an improved understanding of Bermuda as an IFC and its impact on global financial intermediation. This ultimately enhances Bermuda's reputation and re-emphasises our commitment to a high standard of transparency.

Overall, the CPIS aims to improve the statistics of holdings across the globe of portfolio investment assets in the form of equity, long-term debt and short-term debt. Specifically, the IMF has identified the following as the main objectives of the survey:
a) To collect comprehensive information, with geographical detail on the issuer's country of residence, on the stock of cross-border equities, long-term bonds and notes and short-term debt
instruments for use in the compilation or improvement of the International Investment Position (IIP) statistics on portfolio investment capital. The IIP statistics, in turn, can provide information for verifying coverage recorded estimates of portfolio investment financial flows and the associated investment income transactions recorded in the balance of payments
b) To exchange bilateral data. When the results of the CPIS become available, the data may be exchanged among the participating countries and with other countries. By exchanging comparable data (subject to confidentiality constraints), participating countries should be able to improve their statistics of non-resident holdings of their portfolio investment liabilities, as well as associated financial flows and investment income data (information on the geographic distribution of nonresident creditors also becomes known)

### 2.3 What type of information is collected?

The CPIS collects information on economies' cross-border holdings of portfolio investment securities. "Portfolio investment" is defined as cross-border transactions and positions involving debt or equity securities other than those included in the direct investment or reserve assets. A "security" is defined as a financial instrument designed to be traded, i.e. it is characterised by its negotiability and classified as either equity or debt securities.

Equity securities comprise all instruments and records that acknowledge claims on the residual value of corporations or quasi-corporations after the claims of creditors have been met. For the CPIS, mutual funds are also classified as equity regardless of their underlying assets.

Debt securities are negotiable instruments serving as evidence of debt. They give the holders the unconditional right to fixed or contractually determined variable payments (i.e., interest earnings are not dependent on the earnings of the debtors). The maturity of a debt instrument is classified as either long-term or short-term. Long-term debt instruments have a maturity of more than one year or with no stated maturity other than on demand, whereas short-term debt instruments are payable on demand or have a maturity of one year or less).

The CPIS collects data from the asset side only because the holder (the creditor) will usually know what securities it holds. On the liabilities side, the issuer of the security (the debtor) may not know the
residency of the holder because foreign custodians or other intermediaries may hold the securities. Using the assets data reported by CPIS participating economies, the IMF derives liabilities data for all economies; these data are termed 'derived liabilities.

### 2.4 Methodology

The CPIS is administered by the IMF and coordinated locally by the BMA. The 2023 survey was conducted through a questionnaire on a voluntary best-effort basis, using the approach stipulated in the IMF's Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey Guide, (Third Edition), published in $2017^{7}$.

The data is reported in accordance with the residence principle recommended by the IMF's Balance of Payment and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) ${ }^{8}$. Therefore, Bermuda's numbers include data from non-resident entities legally domiciled in Bermuda. However, for the purpose of compiling balance of payments and national income account statistics, non-resident entities are excluded. The size and relevance of the non-resident entities make Bermuda an IFC ${ }^{9}$.

The CPIS questionnaire reflects the period ending on 31 December 2023. It was posted on the BMA's website, and all financial services entities regulated by the Authority and the Government of Bermuda (i.e., banks, insurers, investment funds and pension funds ${ }^{10}$ ) were invited to participate in the exercise. Participants were given up to five weeks to complete the survey. At the end of five weeks, the data received was aggregated for each entity (subsector) at the country level and for each of the securities: equity, long-term debt and short-term debt.

To account for non-response in the insurance subsector, aggregated data was extrapolated using a weighting factor derived from the total assets of all insurers regulated by the BMA. Similarly, aggregated data was extrapolated using a weighting factor derived from the total NAV of all funds regulated by the Authority to account for non-response in the investment funds subsector.

[^2]
### 2.5 Limitations

Bermuda's CPIS statistics are currently based on data collected from the Government of Bermuda and the financial services industry. The data does not include foreign portfolio holdings from other sectors, i.e. non-financial corporations and households ${ }^{11}$.

For the insurance subsector, the survey was limited to commercial (re)insurers only. As of 31 December 2023, commercial (re)insurers made up 85.3\% of the Bermuda-based insurance market when measured by gross premiums written or $86.7 \%$ when measured by assets.

Bermuda has participated in this exercise since 2001 and data collection methodology, sample size and coverage have improved over the years. Therefore, Bermuda's CPIS data is regularly reviewed and assessed for reasonableness. When errors are discovered, data from previous years is revised. As a result of these ongoing improvements, some of the volatilities of Bermuda data trends could be driven by changes in the sampling techniques.

Apart from checking for reasonableness, the Authority does not verify if the allocation of the portfolio holdings provided by respondents, either by type of securities or geographical distribution, is correct. Full reliance is placed on the participating entities that provide the data. However, respondents can reconcile their inputted data on the CPIS main template with the prudential data included in their annual filings.

Under the CPIS data collection methodology, positions in investment funds are indistinctly classified as equity assets. However, the assets held through the intermediation of foreign investment funds might not consist of equity securities only. Additionally, the country of residence of their issuer might differ from that of a mutual fund. Subsequently, the security type and geographical distribution of such assets might be distorted ${ }^{12}$.

## 3. Overview of Bermuda's Foreign Portfolio Holdings

In 2023, Bermuda's foreign portfolio investment assets (foreign portfolio holdings) totalled nearly US $\$ 1.05$ trillion ${ }^{13}$, a decrease of $3.8 \%$ (US\$41.6 billion) from the value attained in 2022. Over the tenyear period from 2013 to 2023, Bermuda's foreign portfolio holdings grew by 135.5\% (US\$602.4 billion), as shown in Table 3.1.

Bermuda's total foreign portfolio holdings have shown a stable growth trend since 2013, with the highest growth recorded in 2022. However, after seeing heightened growth from 2018 onwards, Bermuda's foreign portfolio holdings decreased in 2023. This decline was attributed to a significant 17.2\% decrease in the foreign portfolio holdings held by the investment funds sector (Figure 3.1).

[^4][^5]Bermuda's foreign portfolio holdings consist mainly of debt securities and the value of Bermuda's foreign debt securities holdings was estimated at US\$840.0 billion. This represents $80.2 \%$ of Bermuda's foreign portfolio holdings.

Debt securities consisted predominantly of long-term debt securities, which accounted for $92.5 \%$ (US\$777.0 billion) of total foreign debt securities. Short-term debt securities accounted for 7.5\% (US\$63.0 billion) of total debt securities. Foreign equity securities amounted to US\$207.0 billion or19.8\% of Bermuda's total foreign portfolio holdings (Figure 3.2).

After four years of continued growth and recording their highest-ever values at the end of December 2022, both foreign debt securities and foreign equity securities experienced a decline in their values at the end of 2023.

Year-over-year, total debt securities showed a decrease of 2.2\% (US\$18.7 billion) compared to 2022 and an increase of $125.3 \%$ (US\$467.2 billion) over the ten years from 2013 to 2023. Similarly, equity
securities showed a year-over-year decrease of 10.0\% (US\$22.9 billion) compared to 2022 and an increase of 188.1\% (US\$135.2 billion) over the ten-year period from 2013 to 2023 (Figure 3.3).

In terms of portfolio distribution, the share of holdings on long-term debt securities was $74.2 \%$ compared to an average of $75.1 \%$ for the ten-year from 2013 to 2023. The share of holdings on shortterm debt securities was $6.0 \%$ compared to an average of $7.1 \%$ for the period from 2013 to 2023. The share of holdings for equity securities was $19.8 \%$ compared to an average of $17.7 \%$ for the same period (Figure 3.4).

## 4. Geographical distribution

Bermuda's foreign portfolio holdings have demonstrated a relatively stable geographical distribution over the years, with investment securities issued by US residents and entities dominating Bermuda's foreign portfolio investment assets. The US had a total market value of US\$618.6 billion, or 59.1\% of Bermuda's total foreign portfolio holdings. This represents an increase of 6.2\% (US\$36.1 billion) over 2022. During the period from 2013 to 2023, the US accounted for 57.7\% of total foreign portfolio holdings for Bermuda on average (Figure 4.1).

Other countries that held Bermuda's foreign portfolio holdings in 2023 included the Cayman Islands (4.9\%), the UK (4.3\%), Canada (4.1\%), and Hong Kong (3.8\%). These were followed by Japan and Australia, with shares of $2.3 \%$ and $2.2 \%$, respectively. All Other Countries accounted for the remaining 19.4\% of Bermuda's foreign portfolio holdings (Figure 4.2).

The share of portfolio investment securities issued by US residents and entities increased by five percentage points from $54 \%$ in 2022 to $59 \%$ in 2023. Many of the top 15 countries maintained the same shares as the previous year. However, the share of portfolio investment securities issued by the Cayman Islands and Ireland decreased by two percentage points each (Table 4.1).

Bermuda is predominantly an insurance-based IFC, reflected in foreign portfolio holdings' distribution. The insurance subsector dominated Bermuda's foreign portfolio holdings with an ownership share of 79.8\% (US\$835.0 billion), followed by investment funds, which had a share of 19.4\% (US\$203.4 billion). The banking sector represented a $0.5 \%$ share (US\$5.8 billion). The Government of Bermuda's foreign portfolio holdings amounted to US\$2.8 billion, representing $0.3 \%$ of Bermuda's foreign portfolio (Table 5.1.1).

### 5.2 Insurance

Since the publication of the CPIS report in Bermuda, the insurance subsector has become the leading contributor to foreign portfolio holdings. At the end of 2023, total insurance assets accounted for US\$1,655 billion, or $84.5 \%$ of Bermuda's total financial services sector assets. The insurance sector's foreign portfolio holdings were valued at \$US 835.0 billion, indicating a slight increase of $0.1 \%$ (US\$1.2 billion) over 2022. From 2013, there was a $146.8 \%$ increase (US $\$ 496.7$ billion) in foreign portfolio holdings over ten years.

Consistent with Bermuda's overall foreign portfolio holdings, insurance foreign portfolio investment assets in 2023 were predominately comprised of debt securities. Debt securities accounted for $86.2 \%$ (US $\$ 719.5$ billion) of the insurance sector's total foreign portfolio holdings. In relation to total foreign portfolio holdings, 81.2\% (US\$678.2 billion) were long-term debt securities, and 5.0\% (US\$41.3 billion) were short-term debt securities. Equity accounted for the remaining 13.8\% (US\$115.5 billion) of the insurance sector's total foreign portfolio holdings (Figure 5.2.1).

The amount of long-term debt securities for insurance foreign portfolio holdings has trended upwards since 2012, showing the highest year-over-year growth from 2021 to 2022 with an increase of $26.8 \%$. Long-term debt securities for the insurance sector increased by 3.9\% (US\$25.8 billion) from 2022 to 2023 and grew 117.9\% (US\$366.9 billion) over the ten-year period from 2013 to 2023.

Holdings of short-term debt securities by the insurance sector amounted to US\$41.3 billion for 2023, a significant decrease of $34.2 \%$ (US\$21.5 billion) compared to 2022. From 2013 to 2023, short-term debt securities for the insurance sector also experienced growth, increasing by 226.5\% (US\$28.7 billion).

The value of holdings in equity securities has trended upward since 2013, with the highest value reported in 2021 (US\$ 119.2 billion). Nonetheless, after reporting a very similar figure in 2022 (US\$118.6 billion), the value of equity securities decreased by $2.6 \%$ (US\$3.1 billion) at the end of 2023. Similar to long-term and short-term debt securities, equity securities experienced considerable growth over the ten-year period from 2013 to 2023, growing by US\$101.1 billion (703.2\%) as seen in Figure 5.2.2.

In terms of portfolio distribution, in 2023 the share of equity holdings was $13.8 \%$, compared to an average of $11.7 \%$ for the ten-year period 2013 to 2023. The share of long-term debt holdings in 2023 was $81.2 \%$ compared to an average of $82.6 \%$ for the same ten-year period. The share of short-term holdings in 2023 was $5.0 \%$, compared to the ten-year average of $5.6 \%$ (Figure 5.2.3).

Geographically, the insurance sector's foreign portfolio holdings were very similar to the aggregated foreign portfolio holdings' geographical distribution for Bermuda. In 2023, the US accounted for the largest share of foreign portfolio holdings with 61.9\% (US\$516.5 billion) followed by Hong Kong with 4.6\% (US\$38.8 billion). Canada and the UK had shares of 4.5\% and 4.0\%, respectively, while the Cayman Islands and Australia had a share of 3.2\% and 2.6\%, respectively. All of the other countries accounted for the remaining 19.2\% (Figure 5.2.4).

### 5.3 Investment Funds

As of 31 December 2023, Investment Funds had an NAV of US\$280.9 billion, or 14.3\% of total financial services sector assets in Bermuda. This makes investment funds the second biggest financial subsector in Bermuda after Insurance. In 2023, Investment Funds' foreign portfolio holdings amounted to US\$203.4 billion, a significant decrease of 17.2\% (US\$42.4 billion) compared to 2022. This decline can be attributed to substantial decreases in the short-term debt securities and equity held by the investment funds sector, which saw year over year decreases of $62.7 \%$ and $18.4 \%$, respectively.

Since the beginning of the CPIS in 2001, the highest value of Investment Funds was recorded in 2022 (US\$245.8 billion). In the ten-year period 2013 to 2023, Investment Funds' foreign portfolio holdings have grown by 114.8\% (US\$108.7 billion) (Figure 5.3.1).

In 2023, the allocation of investment funds to equity securities was 43.9\% (US\$89.2 billion) of total foreign portfolio holdings, down from 44.5\% (US\$109.3 billion) in 2022.

Long-term debt securities represented 47.1\% (US\$95.9 billion) of total foreign portfolio holdings for the investment funds sector, up from 35.5\% (US\$87.3 billion) in 2022. Short-term debt securities represented $9.0 \%$ (US\$18.3 billion) of the total foreign portfolio holdings for the investment funds sector, down from 20.0\% US\$49.2 billion) in 2022 (Figure 5.3.2).

At the end of 2023, the geographical distribution of investment funds' foreign portfolio holdings indicates that the US had the largest share at $47.1 \%$ (US\$95.8 billion), followed by the Cayman Islands with a share of $11.7 \%$ (US\$23.8 billion). The UK and Japan had shares of 5.5\% (US\$11.2 billion) and 5.1\% (US\$10.5 billion), respectively, while Mauritius and Ireland had shares of 4.3\% (US\$8.8 billion) and 2.9\% (US\$6.0 billion), respectively. Other Countries accounted for 23.2\% (US\$ 47.3 billion) of the share of total foreign portfolio holdings of the investment funds sector (Figure 5.3.3).

### 5.4 Banks

In 2023, banks' assets accounted for $1.2 \%$ (US\$23.7 billion) of the total financial services assets in Bermuda, making the banking sector the third-largest financial service subsector in Bermuda after the insurance and investment funds sectors.

Foreign portfolio holdings for banks amounted to US\$5.8 billion at the end of 2023. This represents $0.5 \%$ of Bermuda's total foreign portfolio holdings and a decrease of $10.8 \%$ (US $\$ 0.7$ billion) compared to 2022. This was the lowest reported value of foreign portfolio holdings for banks since 2010, which can be attributed to a gradual decrease in banks' investment balances. Following a significant increase in deposits during the COVID-19 pandemic, these funds began to gradually exit the banks in 2023 as customers sought higher-yielding investments due to the high-interest rate environment.

In 2023, banks' foreign portfolio assets were comprised entirely of debt securities. Short-term debt securities represented 56.7\% (US\$3.3 billion) of banks' foreign portfolio holdings, while long-term debt securities represented 43.3\% (US\$2.5 billion) (Figure 5.4.1).

Figure 5.4.1 - Banks' Foreign Portfolio Holdings by Security Type (US\$ Millions): 2023

Year-over-year, short-term debt securities increased by 103.4\% (US\$1.7 billion), and long-term debt securities decreased by $48.4 \%$ (US\$2.3 billion). By the end of 2023, the value of short-term debt securities surpassed the value of long-term debt securities; the last time this happened was in 2011. The rise in short-term debt securities was influenced by the high and rising interest rate environment, which prompted banks to pursue short-term investments to maximise yield (Figure 5.4.2).

Figure 5.4.2 - Banks' Foreign Portfolio Holdings by Security Type (US\$ Millions): 2013 to 2023

In terms of portfolio distribution, in 2023, short-term debt securities had a $56.7 \%$ share of banks' foreign portfolio holdings, compared to the ten-year average of 28.4\% from 2013 to 2023. Long-term debt securities had the other $43.3 \%$ share of banks' foreign portfolio holdings, compared to the tenyear average of 71.2\% for the same period (Figure 5.4.3).

Geographically, the US dominated banks' foreign portfolio holdings, which contributed 72.0\% (US\$4.1 billion) of holdings. Canada contributed 11.5\% (US\$0.7 billion), international organisations contributed 7.1\% (US\$0.4 billion), while Germany and the Netherlands accounted for US\$0.2 billion and US\$0.1 billion, respectively. Other Countries contributed $4.0 \%$ (US $\$ 0.2$ billion) of foreign portfolio holdings.

Overall, the US, Canada and other international organisations have remained among the largest contributors to the banks' foreign portfolio holdings over the years (Figure 5.4.3).

## 6. Bermuda derived liabilities

Derived liabilities highlight the value of securities held by non-residents from the perspective of the economy issuing the securities. Their value is calculated from information reported by the holders of securities (creditor information) ${ }^{14}$. In 2023, the value of Bermuda's derived liabilities was US\$523.5 billion, reflecting an increase of 2.3\% (US\$12.0 billion) over 2022 (Table 6.1).

The US was the largest holder and issuer of portfolio investment assets. In 2023, the US foreign portfolio holdings amounted to US\$23.6 trillion, representing 29.4\% of global total portfolio holdings. The Cayman Islands held the second largest share, holdings of US\$4.9 trillion, or 6.2\% of the total global portfolio holdings (Table 7.1).

### 7.1 International Financial Centres

Foreign portfolio holdings for IFCs varied widely. This can be attributed to several factors, including the heterogeneous nature and size of their financial sectors, their geographical and the methodology they used, among other things. Figure 7.2 compares Bermuda's portfolio holdings and derived liabilities to other IFCs for 2023.

The Cayman Islands reported a significant increase of $97.1 \%$ in its foreign portfolio holdings over the previous year, while Ireland, Switzerland and Luxembourg also reported increases in their foreign portfolio holdings of $17.4 \%, 14.7 \%$, and $11.5 \%$, respectively. Malta reported a significant decrease of 70.0\% in its foreign portfolio holdings year over year. Guernsey also reported a decrease of 10.7\% in its foreign portfolio holdings in 2023.

When comparing derived liabilities to other IFCs, Singapore and Ireland reported significant year-over-year increases of $27.9 \%$ and $21.3 \%$, respectively. Luxembourg, Guernsey and Switzerland also reported increases in their derived liabilities of $9.9 \%, 8.9 \%$ and $7.3 \%$, respectively. Mauritius reported a decrease of 11.7\% in its derived liabilities in 2023.

## Annex A - IMF's Frequently Asked Questions:

## What is the CPIS?

The CPIS is a voluntary data collection exercise conducted under the auspices of the IMF. Participating economies provide data on their portfolio investment securities holdings with data separately requested for equity and investment fund shares and long-term and short-term debt instruments. The survey covers 31 December holdings for 2001-2012 and 30 June holdings, starting from 30 June 2013. All economies are welcome to participate.

The IMF augments the data reported in the CPIS with data from two other surveys, i.e., Securities Held as Foreign Exchange Reserves (SEFER) and Securities Held by International Organisations (SSIO). SEFER provides geographic and instrument details on securities held as reserve assets. SSIO provides geographic and instrument details on securities that international organisations hold. Like the CPIS, SEFER is conducted semi-annually, starting with data from 30 June 2013, whereas SSIO is conducted annually. Data from the CPIS and SSIO surveys provide comprehensive information on holdings of portfolio investment securities, and together with data from the SEFER survey, the geographic detail captured in these three surveys can be used to derive estimates of portfolio investment liabilities for every economy.

In response to requests from data users, several enhancements to the CPIS were implemented, starting with the 30 June 2013 survey. These enhancements include:

- Increased frequency (as noted above, semi-annual CPIS data collections were implemented)
- Improved timeliness (acceleration in both the collection and re-dissemination of data)
- Expanded scope (collection of data on the institutional sector of the non-resident issuer of securities, on short or negative positions, and on the institutional sector of the resident holder cross-classified by the institutional sector of selected non-resident issuers)


## Are foreign direct investment positions included in the CPIS?

Foreign direct investment positions are excluded from the CPIS. However, under the international statistical standards, including the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) and the fourth edition of the OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Investment (BD4), debt positions between financial intermediaries (other than insurance corporations and pension funds) that are in a direct investment relationship are excluded from direct investment and classified instead in a portfolio or other investment. When the data is classified as portfolio investment, the data will be in the scope of the CPIS.

Foreign direct investment is a category of cross-border investment associated with a resident in one economy having control or a significant degree of influence on the management of the enterprise in another economy. In practice, ownership of equity by a direct investor that entitles it to $10 \%$ or more of the voting power is used to determine a significant degree of influence (see BPM6, paragraphs 6.96.18). The IMF's Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS) provides data on bilateral direct investment positions.

## Are loans included in the CPIS?

Generally, no. Loans are financial claims where a creditor lends directly to a debtor and are evidenced by documents that are not negotiable, i.e. cannot be traded (see BPM6 paragraph 5.51). Cross-border
data on loans and deposits are available in the BIS International Locational Banking Statistics database.

However, loans that have become negotiable are reclassified from loans to debt securities and should be included in the CPIS. For such reclassification to occur, there should be evidence of secondary market trading, including the existence of market makers and frequent quotations of the instrument, such as provided by bid-offer spreads (see BPM6 paragraph 5.45).

Are reserve assets included in the CPIS, and how?
As noted above, economies are invited to report data on securities held as reserve assets on the IMF's SEFER survey, which is a companion survey to the CPIS. The results from SEFER are included (along with the SSIO data) in the overall CPIS results. The SEFER data reported by individual reporting economies are not separately identified; SEFER data are disseminated only at an aggregate level.

The CPIS survey (not SEFER) covers portfolio investment securities (as opposed to reserves) held by the monetary authorities.

## Are the holdings of domestic securities covered?

No, the CPIS covers cross-border positions in equity and debt securities. Securities issued and held by residents of the same economy are excluded.

Are securities that a resident holder provides to a non-resident as collateral under a repurchase agreement or a securities lending agreement included in the resident economy's CPIS?

Yes, foreign securities that a resident holder owns and provides as collateral to a non-resident under securities repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements are treated as not having changed economic ownership. These foreign securities remain part of the resident economy's portfolio investment holdings and should be reported in the CPIS.

Are securities that a resident economy acquires from a non-resident as collateral under a reverse repurchase agreement or a securities lending agreement included in the resident economy's CPIS?

No, securities that a resident economy acquires from a non-resident under a reverse repurchase agreement or a securities lending agreement are not treated as having changed economic ownership. These securities remain part of the non-resident's holdings.

Why are there sometimes differences between International Investment Position (IIP) and CPIS data?
The concepts and valuation principles underlying the CPIS are the same as those contained in the BPM6 for valuing the IIP. Therefore, the value of portfolio investment assets in both the CPIS and the IIP should, in principle, be the same. For most of the CPIS-reporting economies, the datasets are generally consistent, with some variances arising from differences in the recording time. There are more substantial differences for a few economies, sometimes due to incomplete sectorial coverage in the CPIS or different data vintages (i.e., the IIP and CPIS may be compiled at other times, so one may have more up-to-date data). For both the CPIS and IIP, portfolio investment securities should be valued at market prices. A few CPIS reporting economies do not compile IIP statistics.

## Can transactions be derived from the position data in the CPIS?

Cross-border securities transactions can only be derived with significant uncertainty using the CPIS data. The CPIS is collecting data on positions from 30 June to 31 December. Flows are defined as the difference between beginning-of-period and end-of-period positions; flows reflect changes that are associated with a) transactions and b) other flows. The latter cover changes recognised analytically under three broad subcategories: other changes in volume, revaluations due to exchange rate changes and other price changes. The CPIS does not contain information to distinguish between transactions and other flows.

Do you have more detailed information that is not published?
No, all data reported to the IMF on the CPIS is published. However, the individual data collected in the two companion surveys (SEFER and SSIO) is reported to the IMF on a strictly confidential basis. These data sets are released only in aggregate form.

Why are sectoral breakdowns not available for some reporting economies?
The reporting of data by sector of the holder is encouraged in the CPIS, but this data breakdown is optional for an economy to participate in the CPIS. Many economies report complete sectoral breakdowns. A few economies report partial sectoral breakdowns and others provide no sectoral breakdowns. The same is true of other encouraged CPIS data.

## Do all economies participate in the CPIS?

No, participation in the CPIS is voluntary. The IMF is actively working on expanding participation, and the most significant portfolio investment-holding economies are participating in the CPIS.

Why are data sets collected from the asset side, and what does "derived liabilities" mean?
More reliable detailed cross-border positions data can usually be collected on an economy's portfolio investment holdings because the holder (creditor) often knows what securities it holds. On the liabilities side, the issuer of a security (debtor) may not know the holder's residency because foreign custodians or other intermediaries may hold the securities. Using the assets data reported by CPIS participating economies, the IMF derives liabilities data for all economies (CPIS reporters and nonreporters); these data sets are termed "derived liabilities". Some economies also report liability data (an encouraged item in the CPIS).

How often is the CPIS updated and revised?
Data sets for 30 June and 31 December are collected by the IMF with a lag of about seven months after the measurement date and published within nine months after the reference date. Economies may submit revisions to previous periods' data at any time, including when submitting data for the most recent period.

Is more high-frequency data available?
The IMF's CPIS database is based on semi-annual data collections that began in January 2014 for the 30 June 2013 observation. However, some economies compile higher or lower frequency data. Further information is available from individual economy metadata tables.

** SEFER + SSIO - securities held as reserve assets and international organisations' holdings


[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ The IMF defines an unrelated non-resident as a non-resident counterparty with an equity interest of less than $10 \%$ in the enterprise, or vice versa. If the counterparty's share is $10 \%$ or more, it is considered a related non-resident (direct investment) and reported under the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS).
    ${ }^{2}$ The figures in this report have been rounded off to the decimal of the billions, except where specified. Some values may differ due to rounding.
    ${ }^{3}$ Insurance sector total assets increased from \$1,633.6 billion in 2022 to $\$ 1,654.5$ billion in 2023 while Net Asset Value (NAV) of investment funds decreased from $\$ 292.7$ billion in 2022 to $\$ 280.9$ billion in 2023. The total assets of banks decreased from $\$ 26.0$ billion in 2022 to $\$ 23.7$ billion in 2023. Total assets data was published in the BMA's 2023 Annual Report.

[^1]:    ${ }^{4}$ Pension funds are included as part of insurance; however, their contribution is less than $1 \%$ of the total insurance foreign portfolio holdings.
    ${ }^{5}$ Derived liabilities show, from the perspective of the economy issuing the securities, the value of securities held by non-residents as "derived" from the information reported by the holders of the securities (creditor information).
    ${ }^{6}$ The "derived liability" numbers are generated only when the sum of reported holdings of securities issued by a given country is at least US\$10 million.

    ${ }^{10}$ For insurance entities, the invitation was only extended to commercial insurers. Pension funds and the Government of Bermuda do not fall under the BMA's directive.

[^3]:    ${ }^{11}$ Several other jurisdictions are currently collecting financial sector data only and do not capture data from households as the mechanism to ask individual householders about their holdings is not practicable.
