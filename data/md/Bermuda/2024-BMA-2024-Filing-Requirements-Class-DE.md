4) Schedule VIIB Expense Risk - in relation to the amendments for the 2024 year-end methodology, the BSCR model has been updated to allow for the inclusion of Expense Risk as a regulatory capital requirement for long-term insurers;
5) Risk Margin Information - in relation to the amendments for the 2024 year-end methodology, the BSCR model has been updated to allow for the inclusion of details of the Risk Margin used for calculation of the full 24 YE BSCR Rules.

## Additional Guidance

i) i) Insurers that write long-term business shall select the valuation basis on the "Insurer Information" tab by choosing "Standard Approach", "Scenario-Based Approach" or "Both".
ii) "Information Sheet" tab paragraph (e) Filing Period - ensure that the filing period start date has been completed and is correct. Note that this will affect the transition rate for the BSCR calculation;
iii) "Information Sheet" tab paragraph (g) Multiplier Exchange/Translation Rate to Bermuda Dollars - ensure that the exchange rate has been completed. Note for insurers that report in currencies other than the Bermuda Dollar or United States Dollar, that the exchange rate to report is the rate to convert the figures to Bermuda Dollar / United States Dollar. For insurers reporting in Bermuda Dollar or United States Dollar, enter 1.000.
For example, if an insurer reported in Canadian Dollars with an exchange rate of CAD to BMD of 0.7657 and BMD to CAD of 1.3060 . the exchange rate to report in paragraph (g) would be 0.7657
iv) "Information Sheet" tab paragraph (m)(iv) - the Authority would like to advise that in relation to paragraph (m)(iv) a qualified opinion would not include qualifications for reporting its financial statements as condensed general purpose financial statements.
