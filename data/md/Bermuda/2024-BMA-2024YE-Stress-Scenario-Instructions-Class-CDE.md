# 2024 CAPITAL AND SOLVENCY RETURN - STRESS/SCENARIO ANALYSIS - CLASS E, CLASS D AND CLASS C

BMA, December 2024

The Bermuda Monetary Authority (the Authority) requires Class E, Class D and Class C insurers ${ }^{1}$ to conduct prescribed stress/scenario testing and analysis. The results are to be submitted to the Authority as part of the 2024 year-end Capital and Solvency Return.

The objective of stress testing within the 2024 year-end Capital and Solvency Return is to assess the capital adequacy of the insurers under adverse financial market and underwriting conditions and provides a comprehensive understanding of the sector's general vulnerability to shocks. More specifically, the purpose of the tests is to assess the impact of the losses, as determined using proprietary/vendor models, on the insurer's Economic Balance Sheet (EBS) (i.e., EBS admitted assets, EBS admitted liabilities, and EBS capital and surplus). Thus, these tests help determine the financial capacity of insurer to absorb the manifestation of key financial risks, such as shocks to investment performance and projected losses arising from specific underwriting risks.

## GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

Measurement of impact: As noted above, the insurer is to provide the post stress/scenario positions of the expected impact and effects on both EBS assets and liabilities.

Accounting treatment: The insurer is to use the accounting standard ordinarily used for statutory reporting so that the pre-stress/scenario EBS capital and surplus can be reconciled to the insurer's 22024023 year-end economic balance sheet.

Timing of impact: The stress/scenario impact and effects reported are those that would be observed immediately upon the occurrence of the event (stress/scenario) as determined by the insurer's internal or vendor model(s) (both with and without the effect of reinsurance and/or other loss mitigation instruments).

Balance sheet date: The insurer is to run the stress/scenario tests based on its balance sheet position and aggregate in-force exposures as at 1 January $2025^{2}$.

Reporting currency:All amounts reported with respect to the stress scenarios must be shown in the reporting currency.

[^0]Reporting Unit: All amounts reported with respect to the stress scenarios must be shown in '000s.
Vendor and/or internal model descriptions: To assist the Authority with comparability, the insurer is to provide a description of the vendor model(s) used to perform the stress/scenario tests, identifying what model and version was used for each stress/scenario. The acquisition of a vendor package is not an obligation. Where an internal model is utilised, the description should also include information on the internal model's key assumptions and parameters.

Confirmation of no loss exposure: For instances where the insurer has no loss exposure to a particular financial market scenario(s), underwriting loss scenario(s) and/or 'other underwriting loss scenarios', the Authority has created a new section that allows for the confirmation that fields left blank/omitted are the result of no loss exposure.

## A. FINANCIAL MARKET SCENARIOS

The financial market scenarios comprise capital market-related single-factor shocks triggered by specific risk factors (equity returns, credit spreads and defaults). The calibration of these shocks is based on historical data about the evolution of interest rates, exchange rates and equity markets. Further, in light of continued sovereign risk concerns and its implications on the investment performance of insurers, the financial market scenarios include haircuts on sovereign bonds. The ongoing volatility due to political risk and also volatility of capital flows warrants shocks on foreign currency positions.

Unless otherwise described the value of all assets and the projected liability cash flows should be recalculated following the stresses. The standard approach curve used to value liabilities should be stressed in scenarios R3 and R5. Standard approach liabilities are only expected to vary in other scenarios to the extent that the expected liability cash flows are impacted by the stress, or where they are denominated in a currency other than the reporting currency.

Scenario Based Approach liabilities should be revalued reflecting the stressed asset values. The spread stress in scenarios R4 and R5 is applied as an instantaneous shock applicable during the first year in the projection. The shock is assumed to be temporary in nature; accordingly, the spreads are assumed to revert back to their base (non-stressed) levels after the first year in the SBA projection. To the extent that, because of the stress in scenarios R1, R2 or R5, there are not enough SBA-eligible assets to use the SBA for the whole business, then the Standard Approach will need to be used for the rest of the business. However, it is import to ensure that there is no splitting of liabilities at policyholder contract level and block-product level. To the extent that the no splitting of liabilities condition cannot be achieved, t the standard approach should be used for the whole business. Where any portion of the liabilities typically use the SBA uses the Standard Approach in a stress, this should be identified in the report submitted as an attachment to the BSCR.

The Risk Margin and BSCR should be recalculated reflecting the impact of the stress on the asset and liability values as appropriate. Where simplifications are made these should be documented and included in the report submitted as an attachment to the BSCR.

The insurer is to quantify the impact of the following stress events on its economic balance sheet:

Stress

### R1. Severe decline in equity prices

### R2.Alternative Investments and Real Estate

Interpretation

The stress test is a decrease of $40 \%$ of the value of equities in a portfolio. This stress scenario is consistent with the Black Monday crash of 1987. If there are hedging instruments for equity exposures, their hedging result should be recorded separately. If hedging is done through replication strategies or continuous rollover of assets, this should be mentioned in the stress test result. Short positions are considered hedging positions. Material equity derivative positions should also be included in the test.

This stress is related to investment holdings in hedge funds, insurance-linked securities, real estate, private placements, venture capital and other types of securities that cannot be characterised as equity, bonds, cash, foreign exchange and mutual funds in typical asset categories or participations to other corporations excluding venture capital. The usual characteristics of these assets are the low correlation with financial markets and the low or lower liquidity compared with typical financial assets. Such assets should be decreased in value by $40 \%$. For assets such as hedge funds with lockup periods, venture capital and real estate in illiquid markets, the (re)insurer should report whether sudden decreases in their value could entail inability for rapid sale and whether this effect has material consequences.
Level 3 Assets A shock of a 40.0\% reduction in the value of level 3 assets should be performed. If level three assets can be found in alternative investments and real estate, equities or other categories, then those assets must be reported and stressed separately.

### R3. Yield Stress

Yield This stress refers to moderate and severe movements in global yields. The (re)insurer will apply the Curve Stress following absolute stresses to the yield curves used for the valuation of assets and liabilities. The stress will apply to all yield curves used (explicitly or implicitly) in those valuations, including (but not limited to) the published risk-free or standard curves, curves used in the SBA calculation, any other curve used for Discount Cash Flows (DCF)-style calculations and yields used to predict policyholder behaviour. Asset values should be revalued assuming constant credit spreads. The resulting yields should not be floored at zero in any of the scenarios.

Insurers are to model each scenario separately but report only the Moderate Widening scenario in the BSCR model.

In the attachments section of the BSCR model, details of all scenarios should be provided.

| Table 1 - Yield Curve Scenarios |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Scenario | Stress |
| Moderate Widening | 1\% increase in yields across all maturities |
| Moderate Tightening | 1\% decrease in yields across all maturities |
| Severe Widening | 2\% increase in yields across all maturities |
| Severe Tightening | $2 \%$ decrease in yields across all maturities |

### R4. General Credit Spreads Widening 
General Credit spreads widen across different rating classes (see Table 2). The widening reflects the increase widening of credit spreads of the perceived credit risk in the market. The table summarises the shocks.

| Table 2. Credit Spread Widening <br> In basis points |  |  |  |  |  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| AAA | AA | Rating Category |  |  |  |
| 199.6 | 249.0 | 241.5 | BBB | BB | Below BB |

Source: BMA staff calculations and Bloomberg. Notes: The 99.9th percentile was used for all but two scenarios. For AAA we used the 99th percentile, for junk bonds (ratings Below BB ) we used the 99.99th percentile. The spreads in these rating classes show high (for AAA ) or low (for Below BB ) variability compared to the intermediate rating classes. The 99th percentile would overestimate the reasonable stress scenario for AAA assets and it would underestimate a reasonable stress scenario for Below BB. We used the Moody's bond indices for ratings from AAA to BBB and the J. P. Morgan bond indices for BB and Below BB rating classes. The reference risk free rate was the 10-year U.S. treasury rate

All positions including available for sale and held to maturity should be stressed. Structured finance products, asset-backed securities, agency and non-agency Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)s must be included as well. If there is no rating for an asset, the (re)insurer must assume that the rating is Below BB. Catastrophe (CAT) Bonds are treated as alternative investments and not as assets susceptible to credit spread changes.

### R5.Combine

Combine the Moderate Widening stress from R3 with the stresses from R1, R2 and R4. This means that R1, R2, corporate bonds must be revalued using the risk-free curve and prevailing credit spread at the valuation date R3 and plus the Moderate Widening scenario from R3 plus the widening of credit spreads from R4. Sovereign bonds R4 and other assets with DCF-style valuation methods should be valued as in R3.

### R6.FX
An equal percentage of depreciation and/or appreciation of Foreign Exchange (FX) positions in both assets and Foreign liabilities when these shocks reduce the value of assets and increase the value of liabilities. When an FX liability currency is passed on the party claiming the liability, the shock can be excluded for such positions. Table 3 provides the shocks percentage depreciations/appreciations. Hedging of FX positions should be reported separately, especially if hedging is done with roll-over strategies.

Table 3. Exchange Rate Shocks (In percent)

|  | EUR/USD | JPY/USD | GBP/USD | CHF/USD | AUD/USD | Avg. |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Shock | 24.9 | 27.6 | 41.0 | 22.4 | 31.8 | 29.5 |

### R7.Sovereign Debt
Escalation of In this test we assume that the weakest sovereigns will have to undergo a haircut in Sovereign risk the face value of their debt. Both available for sale and held to maturity bonds should be stressed.

Source BMA staff calculations and Bloomberg. The haircuts are based on the realization of a prolonged pan-European banking crisis in Europe which will cause sovereign defaults.

### R8. Inflation and Monetary Policy Risk

Inflation risk reflects the unexpected change in prices.
Higher than expected inflation may increase the value of indemnities, claims and expenses such as salaries, where these are not contractually fixed. Simulate a scenario similar to the 2024 inflationary scenario.
The (re)insurer should apply each inflation scenario for three years assuming no initial action to curb inflation from central banks. In year four, the central bank changes stance and increases rates to restore the current real interest rate. From year five onwards, inflation and interest rates return to current levels.

Table 5 - Moderate and Severe Inflation Rates

| Scenario | $\begin{aligned} & \hline \text { Change in } \\ & \hline \text { inflation } \\ & \text { rate (Y1) } \end{aligned}$ | $\begin{aligned} & \hline \text { Change in } \\ & \hline \text { inflation } \\ & \text { rate (Y2) } \end{aligned}$ | $\begin{aligned} & \text { Change in } \\ & \hline \text { inflation } \\ & \text { rate (Y3) } \end{aligned}$ | Change in inflation and interest rate (Y4) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Moderate <br> Inflation | +5.0\% | +5.0\% | +5.0\% | +5.0\% |
| Severe Inflation | +10.0\% | +10.0\% | +10.0\% | +10.0\% |

To clarify, these stresses should be additively applied to the prevailing annual inflation/interest rate assumption used in valuing asset and liabilities (e.g., if the prevailing assumption is 3\% p.a. then the moderate stressed assumption should be $8 \%$ p.a. for the first four years before returning to 3\% p.a.).

Table 6 - Deflation Inflation Rates

| Scenario | Stressed inflation rate |
| :--- | :--- |
| Deflation scenario | $-1.0 \%$ |

This stress should replace the prevailing annual inflation rate assumption used in valuing assets and liabilities (e.g., if the prevailing assumption is $3 \%$ p.a. then the deflation scenario assumption should be $-1 \%$ p.a., i.e., a $4 \%$ p.a. reduction in expectations). The interest rate assumption in year four should mirror the change in the inflation rate (i.e., $-4 \%$ p.a. in the previous example).

All assets and liabilities are to be shocked. In a situation where the (re)insurer holds TIPS or other inflation-sensitive securities, these securities should be indexed to the inflation scenarios. Insurers are to model each scenario separately and report the scenario that has the most significant impact in the BSCR model. In the attachments section of the BSCR model, details of all scenarios should be provided.

1) The R9 Long Term Liquidity Stress Scenario is a stress test to assess a business's ability to withstand the liquidity stress arising from mass lapse shock events and depressed asset value.
2) Under this stress scenario, stresses are applied to both assets as well as liabilities.
3) Haircuts are applied to market values of predefined liquid assets, reflecting 1 in 20 and 1 in 200 worst market movements.
4) In addition, liquid assets are divided into 3 tiers in order to decrease liquidity, with tier 3 assets only allowed to make up no more than $30 \%$ of all liquid assets. Assets not predefined in the stress test for liquidity purposes are not considered liquid for the purpose of this stress test and would be subject to a 100\% haircut.
5) Application of shocks: The mass lapse shocks are to be applied to all lapsable policies, whether lapsing is beneficial for the insurer from a solvency perspective or not (i.e., the shocks apply to both lapse-supported and lapse-sensitive policies). For purposes of the stress test, the prescribed shocks on the Mass Lapse Shock table are applied to cash surrender values as factors. i.e., the cash surrender value for the respective policyholder group multiplied by the corresponding factor in the Mass Lapse Schock table, with the totals feeding into the Liquidity Coverage Ratio calculation. The mass lapse cash outflow should be unchanged under both the 1 in 20 and 1 in 200 market stresses.
6) The overall liquidity coverage ratio of the registrant post application of the stresses is expected to be no less than 105\%. Additional information related to the Mass Lapse Shock stress and associated table(s) as well as the Liquidity Source table and haircuts applied is provided below.
7) Scope of R9 Scenario: This is required for Long-Term (re)insurers, Long-Term groups, and dual insurers. A dual insurer need not fill in the R9 Scenario if it meets both these conditions: (i) long-term unconsolidated assets are less than $20 \%$ of total assets, (ii) long-term gross unconsolidated reserve is less than \$2.5bn.
8) Pre-stress liquidity sources are pre-stress liquidity amounts available to the (re)insurer to meet liquidity needs under each liquidity source. The values are expected to be reflective of the corresponding EBS values. For the purpose of this stress test, the following definitions shall be applicable:

| Liquidity Source Type | Definition or Clarification |
| :--- | :--- |
| Tier 1 Certificates of Deposit | Should be withdrawable within 48 hours without <br> economic penalties |
| Tier 2 Certificates of Deposit | Should be withdrawable within 7 days without <br> economic penalties |
| Tier 3 Certificates of Deposit | Certificates of Deposit not falling within Tier 1 or <br> Tier 2 |
| Qualified Tier 1 Liquid Mutual and <br> MMFs | Contain cash \& cash equivalents, sovereigns A- or <br> better, max 20\% IG PSE, and max 10\% of any of: <br> IG Covered Bonds, BBB Sovereigns, BBB PSE, IG <br> Corporates, GSE A- or better - all withdrawable <br> within 48 hours with no penalty or deductions |
| Qualified Tier 2 Liquid Mutual and <br> MMFs | Contain cash \& cash equivalents, Tier 1 mutual fund <br> and MMFs with withdrawal period of up to 7 days, <br> max 50\% IG Corporates, up to 20\% of IG PSE and |
| 10\% of IG GSE or IG Covered Bonds - all <br> withdrawable within 7 days without any penalties or <br> deductions |  |
| Qualified Tier 3 Liquid Mutual and <br> MMFs | Should only contain cash \& cash equivalents, <br> mutual funds that would ordinarily be Tier 1 except <br> for longer withdrawal notice of 30 days, publicly <br> traded equity, IG corporates, IG GSE, IG PSE or IG <br> Covered Bonds - all withdrawable in less than 30 <br> days |
| All Other Potential on Balance Sheet <br> Liquidity Sources | Please include the remaining assets that are part of <br> the economic balance sheet. i.e., off balance sheet <br> sources of liquidity are to be excluded. |


| Public Corporates rated between BBB- and AA- | Include BBB- rated Corporates but exclude AA- |
| :---: | :---: |
| Sovereigns rated between BBB- and AA- | Include BBB- rated Sovereigns but exclude AA- |
| Mortgage Based Securities rated AAA | To qualify, the assets should be rated AAA by at least one of the three major rating agencies - Fitch, Moody's \& S\&P |
| Other Structured Securities rated AAA | To qualify, the assets should be rated AAA by at least one of the three major rating agencies - Fitch, Moody's \& S\&P |

9) Cap on tier 3 assets: Tier 3 assets cannot make up more than $30 \%$ of the total post stress liquidity sources. The cap will automatically apply.
10) WAM x yield shock liquidity stresses: For assets where yield shocks are applied instead of haircuts to calculate post stress liquidity source values, the market value weighted average maturity (WAM) of the assets for every specified asset category must be provided. The maturity of securities within each asset category should reflect the greater of the contractual maturity or the maturity with any extension features embedded. Early prepayment or callable dates are ignored. A market value floor of zero is applied to prevent market values from becoming negative.
11) Total Cash out-flow under the immediate mass lapse shock (mass lapse out-flow) is the calculated payout (outgo) for lapse risk sensitive and lapse supported policies/ products in case of a mass lapse scenario. This value will automatically populate and is expected to affect the Available Capital and Surplus that will be used in calculating post-stress ECR.
12) Available Capital \& Surplus (C\&S) and the Enhanced Capital Requirement (ECR) pre and post mass lapse stress scenarios: The ECR ratio from each of the respective pairs of available C\&S and ECR should be populated on the same basis as that used in filings, i.e., regulatory transitional arrangements where applicable are allowed. Further, the asset market values (MVs) for the remaining assets should be returned to their pre-stressed MVs (after reducing them by the amount of the mass lapse shock outflow). It is not required that yield shocks are applied to liability discount curves.
13) Total Best Estimate Liability (BEL) by Category (the BEL table): The BEL of the policies sensitive to lapse risk and the lapse supported policies that fall within the sub-groups indicated should be populated in this table. For example, Column E, first row of the table (Low (no economic penalty)) should be the BEL of policies that have no economic surrender penalty, where policy conditions and/ or policyholder reasonable expectations stipulate that funds are availed within 1 week of surrender request that are owned by retail policyholders. However, the second row is BEL relating to group of policies owned by retail policyholders whose surrender proceeds will be availed within 1 week and the surrender charge applicable to the group of policies is up to $20 \%$, etc.
14) Total Account Value by Category: The Account Values of the policy groups should be as reported under local GAAPs. The policy grouping is the same as that defined under the BEL table.
15) Total Cash Surrender Value by Category: For the purposes of the mass lapse shock, the cash surrender value is defined as the amount that would be paid out if a policy was surrendered immediately. The table should include all products that are exposed to lapse risk, i.e., all lapse sensitive, and lapse supported products are required to be included. The policy groups are as defined under the BEL table.
16) Retail vs institutional: The 'Retail' heading in the Mass Lapse Shock table means policies where the policyholder is a retail customer. The 'Institutional' heading in the Mass Lapse

Shock table means policies where the policyholder is not a retail customer (e.g., is a corporation or institution). In the case of reinsurance business, the classification of a policy as retail or institutional should be based on the original policyholder (the one that holds the policy issued by the direct writer), not on the cedent. As such, reinsurance contracts are not automatically classified as institutional contracts.
17) Economic penalty: This only includes contractual penalties (i.e., surrender charges) imposed by the insurer on policyholders that surrender early. It does not include Market Value Adjustments (MVA). It also does not include penalties that are imposed by third parties, or are not explicitly quantified in the contract, such as the economic value of foregone benefits (e.g., tax penalties or other tax implications).
18) Time restraints: These are based on the average time between the request by a policyholder and the settlement under the normal course of business.
19) Products Not Sensitive to Lapse (table): Product information for products not exposed to any lapse risk should be provided in this table, including their name, BEL and cash surrender values.

## B. UNDERWRITING SCENARIOS

The insurer is to submit to the Authority three of its own underwriting loss scenarios and also use these in the calculation under Section D. Worst Case Annual Aggregate Loss Scenario below. The insurer is to submit the following for each of the three scenarios:
a) Description of the scenarios and related key assumptions; and
b) The post stress/scenario positions on aggregate EBS assets and EBS liabilities that would be observed immediately upon the occurrence of the event (stress/scenario) (both with and without the effect of reinsurance and/or other loss mitigation instruments).

## C. RATING DOWNGRADE

The insurer is to submit detailed qualitative disclosure of the impact upon both its statutory statement of income and liquidity positions of a ratings downgrade of its Bermuda legal entity by two notches or below A-, whichever is lower. The disclosure should cover and provide an indication of the relative impact/severity of collateral requirements, loss payment triggers on in-force policy contracts, claw-backs, and/or other adverse financial and liquidity implications of the downgrade.

Upon reviewing the disclosure, the Authority may request additional information relating to the liquidity impact and potential losses.

## D. WORST-CASE ANNUAL AGGREGATE LOSS SCENARIO

The insurer is to submit the following:

### 1. A combination of a financial market scenario and three largest underwriting scenarios

The aggregate impact of:
a) A financial market scenario under Section A above which would result simultaneously in the occurrence of R5; and
b) An aggregation of the three net underwriting losses under Section III above.

It is assumed that the underwriting loss events follow in quick succession and there is the inability to engage in capital or other fundraising activities. Further, it is assumed that there is no geographic correlation between these non-economic events. The insurer is to disclose its assumptions, including any magnified demand surge, if applicable, from the multiple events.

### 2. Insurer specific worst-case scenario

The insurer is to submit a description of its own worst-case annual aggregate loss scenario and the underlying assumptions. The scenario should be at a level considered extreme but plausible by the insurer.

## E. REVERSE STRESS TEST SCENARIO

If an insurer performs reverse stress testing (as outlined in the CISSA IX(b) question 2), then the insurer is to provide the key assumptions, which includes specific market risk scenarios, loss figures and return period that would cause such business failure. Such scenarios should be reported and should be contrasted with the scenarios in the current guidelines, i.e. whether worse or better scenarios than those provided by the BMA cause the (reinsurance company to fail).

If the insurer does not perform Reserve Stress Tests, then insurers are to calculate the clearance between their available economic capital and surplus and enhanced capital requirement (ECR) to determine the size of loss that would cause them to breach their ECR and provide the occurrence and relative return period of such event.

## F. TECHNOLOGY RISK

All (re)insurers, including those that do not underwrite cyber risk, shall complete the questions in section A \& B Technology Risk- 'Insurer own cyber security and resilience capabilities'. Responses will be selected from the drop down list or typed in as required and relevant documents will be included indicating the document name and identifying the applicable page numbers.


[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ In this document, the terms 'insurer' and 'insurers' include 'reinsurer' and 'reinsurers,' respectively.
    ${ }^{2}$ Where the fiscal year does not correspond to the calendar year, in-force exposures on the day following the fiscal year-end should be used rather than 1 January 2025.
