## Long-term risk
20. The risk module charge calculation for long-term business shall be determined in accordance with the following formula-

$$
\begin{aligned}
& C_{L T}=L T_{-} \text {TransitionalFactor } \times C_{L T, \text { New }} \\
&+\left(1-L T_{-} \text {TransitionalFactor }\right) \times C_{L T, \text { old }}
\end{aligned}
$$

Where-[^1]

LT_TransitionalFactor

$=$ the transitional factor that increases, from $10 \%$ for the financial year beginning on or after $1^{\text {st }}$ January 2024, in equal 10 percentage point increments for each subsequent financial year until it reaches 100\% for the financial year ending on or after $1^{\text {st }}$ January 2033, and stays at $100 \%$ for all financial years thereafter.

When projecting future Long-Term Insurance Risk charges for the purposes of the Risk Margin calculation, insurers may keep the $L T_{-}$TransitionalFactor fixed at its actual value as of the applicable valuation date ie., without reflecting further run-off of the transitional within the Risk Margin projection.

INSTRUCTIONS AFFECTING TABLE 2B: Shocks for Eqastclass $_{i}$

- (a) all assets (except regulated non-insurance financial operating entities) and liabilities (except the risk margin) whose value is subject to equity risk shocks are to be reported on a basis consistent with that used for the purposes of economic balance sheet reporting. Such assets and liabilities shall include equity risk exposures determined by application of the "look-through" approach calculated in accordance with criteria prescribed by the Authority for the following items:

	- (i) collective investment vehicles and other investments packaged as funds, including related undertakings used as investment vehicles;
	- (ii) segregated accounts assets and liabilities;
	- (iii) deposit asset and liabilities;
	- (iv) assets and liabilities held by ceding insurers or under retrocession;
	- (v) other sundry assets and liabilities; and
	- (vi) derivatives.

- (b) for asset types referred to in paragraph (a) (i) to (vi) where the "look through" approach cannot be applied, the residual balance shall be included in "Equity Securities - Other Investments";

- (c) short exposures qualifying as assets held for risk-mitigation purposes and short exposures not qualifying as assets held for risk-mitigation purposes, shall both be determined in accordance with criteria prescribed by the Authority; and

- (d) amounts are to be reported on an EBS Valuation basis.

## Equity investment
23A. The equity investments that are eligible to be used in the calculation of $C_{\text {equity }}^{\text {grandfather }}$ as defined in paragraph 22 are determined as follows:

i. The average value of equities as percentage of total assets over the prior three financial year ends before January $1^{\text {st }} 2019$ (i.e., over the financial years ending 2016 to 2018) is calculated.

a. Similarly, for each class of equities in accordance with Table $2 \mathrm{~B}$, the average amounts as a percentage of total equities shall be determined over the same prior three years, i.e. the allocations for each equity class.

ii. The total amount of equities eligible to be used in the calculation of $C_{\text {equity }}^{\text {grandfathed }}$ as defined in paragraph 22 at each year end is determined by multiplying the amount of legacy reserves by the equity percentage of paragraph i., where

a. "Legacy reserves" are defined as the long term best estimate labilities, at the applicable point in time (financial year-end), for insurance business carried on as at December 31st 2018.

b. The total amount of equities eligible to be used in the calculation of $C_{\text {equity }}^{\text {grandfatheed }}$ as defined in paragraph 22 at each year end shall not be greater than the amount of the legacy reserves.

iii. The equity investments eligible to being used in the calculation of $C_{\text {equity }}^{\text {grandfatheed }}$ as defined in paragraph 22 per equity class are calculated by multiplying the total amount in paragraph ii. by the equity class allocation in paragraph i.

iv. Future applicable reserves shall be capped at the initial reserve. The amount of equities eligible to be used in the calculation of $C_{\text {equity }}^{\text {grandfatheed }}$ as defined in paragraph 22 can therefore never be greater than the initial amount.

v. Equities that are eligible to be used being used in the calculation of $C_{\text {equity }}^{\text {grandfatheed }}$ as defined in paragraph 22 may be traded or replaced within a specific equity class and still receive the aforementioned treatment.

## Interest rate/liquidity risk
24. The interest rate/liquidity risk charge calculation may be calculated in accordance with paragraph 4 or the formula below. Where an insurer decides to utilise the formula below, it will only be allowed to revert back and utilise the calculations prescribed in paragraph 4 where it has received the written approval of the Authority pursuant to an application made in accordance with section 6D of the Act.

NoOffset = calculation with 'no offset' means that the results of the mass lapse stress for any homogeneous risk groups for which the mass lapse is beneficial are floored at zero (i.e., gains from policies where lapsing is beneficial for the insurer are not allowed to offset losses from policies where lapsing is adverse for the insurer);


FullOffset = calculation with 'full offset' means that results of the mass lapse stress for different homogeneous risk groups are not floored to zero (i.e., gains from policies where lapsing is beneficial are allowed to offset losses from policies where lapsing is adverse)

- (a) The valuation of assets and liabilities shall be performed on an EBS valuation basis. Upon application, those insurers using the scenario-based approach may elect to use a modification to keep the scenario-based approach discounting unchanged under certain lapse stresses as prescribed by the Authority, subject to prior approval from the Authority;

- (b) When applying the prescribed lapse stresses and recalculating the post-stress values of assets and liabilities, insurers shall take into account all applicable legal or contractual rights of policyholders (policyholder options) that may alter the value of the future cash flows of the (re)insurance contracts entered into by the insurer. The relevant policyholder options shall include all legal or contractual rights to:

	- (i) fully or partially terminate, surrender, decrease, restrict or suspend insurance cover or permit the insurance policy to lapse;
	- (ii) fully or partially establish, renew, increase, extend or resume insurance cover.

- (c) The lapse stresses to be applied in determining the lapse risk charges per region in accordance with the lapse risk charge equation under paragraph 34A are as follows:

	- (i) Europe\&UK: means (re)insurance business originating from the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK). The Lapse Up, Lapse Down and Mass Lapse stresses shall be those as prescribed in the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014 supplementing Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II), as amended. For the purposes of this paragraph, any reference to any laws, rules and regulations shall also include successors to and functionally equivalent replacements of such laws, rules and regulations.
	- (ii) For (re)insurance business originating from all other regions (i.e., from regions Japan and US\&Other):
		- (a) Lapse Up: A permanent stress increase in assumed lapse rates, for all policies in homogeneous risk groups adversely affected by such increases. The permanent stress increase shall be as prescribed in Table 13B; in all cases subject to an absolute maximum rate of $100 \%$. For the purposes of the stress, increase in lapse rates means an increase in the policyholder option exercise rates defined in subparagraph (b).(i) and a decrease in the policyholder option exercise rates defined in subparagraph (b).(ii). The changes in option exercise rates shall only apply to those relevant options for which the change results in a loss. For each homogeneous risk group, the loss resulting from the stress shall be subject to a floor of zero.
		
		- (b) Lapse Down: A permanent stress decrease in assumed lapse rates, for all policies in homogeneous risk groups adversely affected by such decreases. The permanent stress decrease shall be as prescribed in Table 13B. For the purposes of the stress, decrease in lapse rates means a decrease in the policyholder option exercise rates defined in subparagraph (b).(i) and an increase in the policyholder option exercise rates defined in subparagraph (b).(ii). The changes in option exercise rates shall only apply to those relevant options for which the change results in a loss. For each homogeneous risk group, the loss resulting from the stress shall be subject to a floor of zero.
		
		- (c) Mass Lapse: An immediate discontinuance of insurance policies. The annual mass lapse stress magnitude shall be, for each insurance policy, equal to three times the applicable annual base lapse rate assumptions for that policy, but in no event shall be lower than the absolute floor prescribed in Table 13C applicable to that policy. The stressed mass lapse rate shall apply for the first 12 months within the projections used to determine the best estimate of insurance liabilities. The mass lapse charge shall be calculated both without offset (NoOffset) and with full offset (FullOffset), and the average of the two calculations shall be taken in accordance with the lapse risk charge equation under paragraph 34A (a ' $50 \%$ offset').

$$
C_{A d j T P}=-\max (\min (\text { Basic BSCR }- \text { Basic nBSCR,FDB }), 0)
$$

Where,

Basic BSCR $=\sqrt{\sum_{i, j} \operatorname{CorrBBSCR}_{i, j} \times C_{i} \times C_{j}} \quad$ Basic nBSCR $=\sqrt{\sum_{i, j} \operatorname{CorrBBSCR}_{i, j} \times n C_{i} \times n C_{j}}$

$\operatorname{CorrBBSC}_{i, j}=$ the correlation factors of the Basic BSCR correlation matrix in accordance with Table A or Paragraph 18;

$C_{i}$ $=$ risk module charge $i$ which are replaced by the following:

$$
C_{\text {Market }}, C_{L T}, C_{\text {Credit }}
$$

$C_{\text {Market }}=\quad \begin{aligned} & \text { market risk module charge as calculated in accordance with } \\ & \text { paragraph 19; }\end{aligned}$

$C_{L T} \quad=\quad$ Long-Term risk module charge as calculated in accordance with paragraph 20;

$C_{\text {Credit }}=$ credit risk module charge as calculated in accordance with paragraph 27.

$n C_{i}$ $=$ net risk module charge $i$ which are calculated the same way as $C_{i}$ but by allowing the future discretionary benefits to change and by allowing managements actions to be performed in accordance to with the criteria prescribed by the Authority and which are replaced by the following:

$$
n C_{\text {Market }}, \quad n C_{L T}, n C_{\text {Credit }}
$$

$F D B \quad=\quad$ net present value of future bonuses and other discretionary benefits.

38. The adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes shall be established in accordance with the following formula-

$C_{\text {otheradj }}=\operatorname{Min}\left(\left(\left(\right.\right.\right.$ Basic BSCR $\left.+C_{\text {operational }}+C_{\text {regulatoryadj }}+C_{\text {AdjTP }}\right) \times t$, Limit,$\left(\right.$ Basic BSCR $\left.\left.+C_{\text {operational }}+C_{\text {regulatoryadj }}+C_{\text {AdjPP }}\right) \times 20 \%\right)$

Where -

Basic BSCR = Basic BSCR risk module charge as calculated in accordance with paragraph 18 ;

$C_{\text {operationd }}=$ operational risk charge as calculated in accordance with paragraph 35;
