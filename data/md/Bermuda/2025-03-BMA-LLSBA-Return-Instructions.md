### OVERVIEW

#### A.1. Background

1. The Bermuda Monetary Authority (Authority or BMA) reviews Bermuda's regulatory and supervisory regimes to ensure that the jurisdiction adheres to international standards and best practices for insurance regulation and supervision.
2. In that regard, in 2015 the Authority implemented changes to its regime for commercial insurers and insurance groups to enhance the statutory and prudential requirements.
3. Further, in February and July 2023, the Authority issued two Consultation Papers (CP) entitled Proposed Enhancements to the Regulatory Regime and Fees for Commercial Insurers. The BMA invited stakeholders to submit feedback on the proposed enhancements. The enhancements covered a number of areas, including Technical Provisions, Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR) computation and Section 6D enhancements. Copies of the CPs, guidance notes, prudential standards and instructions can be found on the BMA's website.
4. Engagement with stakeholders on the proposed Lapse, Liquidity and Scenario-Based Approach Return (LLSBA) continued, and a final template was published in October 2024. The template and accompanying instructions can be found on the BMA's website.
5. These documents provide instructions on how to complete the LLSBA template for the purposes of Scenario-Based Approach (SBA) model approval, asset approvals and year-end filings.
6. For purposes of asset approval under the SBA, registrants should complete all asset-related tabs, as well as all derivative-related tabs that are used in the SBA. However, registrants are not required to complete the SBA, lapse, or liquidity-related tabs. However, companies that use a standard approach and seek approval for affiliated assets should also complete all asset tabs.
7. For year-end filings, insurers that use the SBA should complete all tabs.
8. For year-end filings, insurers that use the standard approach should complete all asset-related tabs and the Cash Flows - Asset-related, Lapse Profile and Liquidity Projections tabs.
9. References in this document to 'insurer' shall also include 'reinsurers' and 'Bermuda Groups' unless specifically excluded.

## B. Lapse, Liquidity and SBA Template - Asset Reporting

This section provides instructions on how to complete the LLSBA template on a column-by-column basis for the tabs relating to Assets and Derivatives.

The table below reflects an indicative asset class mapping from relevant BSCR Schedules to the Lapse-Liquidity-SBA-Return Template. The mapping is only indicative and is solely intended to aid insurers in categorising assets into the LLSBA template categories. In some cases, more than one mapping may be possible, depending on the specifics of the case (and any specific instructions or directions by the BMA). Insurers are expected to perform classification based on the nature, characteristics and risks of specific assets in compliance with prudential rules, instructions and relevant guidance. This helps to avoid potential confusion during the BSCR process and, in particular, for Schedules IIx, which outline the capital requirement calculations.

| Tranche Thickness (\%) | This represents the percentage of the total capital/collateral structure that the respective tranche accounts for. |
| Subordination (\%) | The percentage of the total capital that is subordinate to the tranche in question. |
| Interest Coverage Ratio (\%) | This is calculated by dividing the Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) by the interest payable for the current year. |

17. A commercial mortgage loan, or commercial real estate loan, is a legally enforceable mortgage secured by a first lien on commercial property as opposed to residential property. Commercial Real Estate (CRE) refers to finished property that is used for non-residential purposes, such as (but not limited to) offices, retail space, hospitals, hotels and warehouses. Residential buildings with more than four dwelling units are also considered CRE.

### C.1.6 SBA Analysis of Change

40. An Analysis of Change is an important control to help insurers validate their key metrics and understand the drivers of the movement in a metric from one time period to the next.
41. In the case of the SBA , the Authority requires insurers to provide a detailed analysis of change for a) the SBA BEL for the biting scenario and b) the implied SBA Spread relative to the underlying RiskFree Rate.
42. Commentary capturing the key reasons for any movement should be provided. For example, if there have been several model changes, the commentary should articulate which particular changes contributed materially to the observed impact for that step.
43. An analysis of change should be performed individually for each sub-portfolio representing a material exposure to the insurer, up to a maximum of ten.
44. 'Material exposure' should be determined by the insurer in an appropriate manner that is documented. This recognises that using the BEL to determine the 'largest' sub-portfolios may not always be suitable. For example, a general account product with a low BEL but a high sum assured could be considered material within the insurer's risk management framework. Hence, it should be included in this example even if it has a lower BEL than other products.
45. If there are more than ten sub-portfolios, or if more than one sub-portfolio is demonstrably small, subportfolios may be combined in the 'Aggregate of all other small portfolios' row. The justification should be documented.
46. The Authority recognises that the steps below may differ from the insurer's internal process. If this is the case, the insurer should state how their steps differ and comment on how this impacts the allocation of movement in the accompanying documentation.
47. The Authority expects most of the analysis to be performed using model runs rather than estimates. If an estimate is used for any of the steps, the insurer should describe how the calculation was made and justify why this is appropriate in the accompanying documentation.
48. An insurer's processes are expected to automatically produce an analysis of change for each subportfolio by the required steps outlined in the table below. However, steps may be simplified for less material sub-portfolios as long as the analysis remains appropriate and information is not lost.
49. Similarly, analyses of change inevitably require some judgment, particularly in the 'Updated Risk-Free Rate' step. It would not be practical to provide an exhaustive list of instructions on adjusting them for every scenario that might arise. While the instructions in the table below include information on how each step should be considered, it is recognised that judgment may be required.
50. The overarching expectation is that the overall analysis of the drivers of the change in BEL and SBA Spread will provide an 'allocation of impacts' that can be articulated and justified within the insurer's governance system and other stakeholders.
51. An analysis of change would typically be an annual exercise. Still, for the first year of implementing the SBA, the insurer should discuss with their supervisor whether an interim analysis of change would
be appropriate. For example, if Q2 figures were reported to the BMA using the SBA, then a Q2 to Q4 analysis would normally be required.
52. For year-end 2024 reporting, the BMA acknowledges that insurers may have to build the necessary tools and processes to complete this tab as expected, so a best-endeavours approach is encouraged.

Completion of this tab - To avoid doubt, BEL excludes the LapC adjustment.

| SBA Analysis of Change |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Field | Description |
| Description of Products | For each sub-portfolio, describe the main product(s). |
| BEL - Base Scenario | State the base closing BEL for each sub-portfolio. |
| BEL - Scenario | State the closing BEL for each sub-portfolio's eight interest rate scenarios. |
| BEL (after AOC step) | Calculated BEL having made all the changes up to and including each analysis of change (AOC) Step, as defined below. |
| Implied SBA Spread | Implied SBA Spread, relative to the firm's risk-free rate set out in C1.1, for each AOC Step. |
| Step | Description |
| Prior Period (start) | On the biting scenario, the prior period's closing BEL would normally be as reported at the end of the Prior Period. |
| Model Changes | BEL as valued at the prior period (start) that includes: <br> - Changes in the methodology that impact the BEL calculation <br> - Asset and liability methodology changes <br> - Assumption changes in this step <br> - Itemisation of the impact of any material assumption changes ( $5 \%$ or greater of start of period BEL) in the 'Other' section below. |
| Unwind | At this stage: <br> The asset and liability portfolios should be rolled forward based on the following information: <br> - The valuation/calculation date should be updated to reflect the end of period date <br> - All curves used within the model (both interest rate and inflation rate curves) should be rolled forward to reflect the change in date <br> - Spot interest rate curves need to be recalculated as at the end of period date using the forward rates implied by the start of period spot curves <br> - Discount rates should be calculated using the appropriate rolled-forward spot interest rate curves <br> - Inflation curves should be rolled forward by rebasing projected inflation at the start of the period projected inflation index. This implies no changes to inflation expectations <br> - There should be no change to the asset and liability cash flows other than that the cash flows that are projected to occur over the year to which the AOC applies are fulfilled <br> - Cash balances should reflect the net impact of the asset and liability cash flows dropped due to the date update <br> - Asset market values should be rolled forward to reflect the change in promised cash flows and the impact of rolling cash flow indices (interest rate reference curves and inflation index curves) forward |


|  | - At this stage there should be no change to the IRR calculated for each asset at the end of period date versus the start of period date. <br> - This should be demonstrated by calculating the asset portfolio IRR before and after the above-stated rolled-forward updates <br> The asset and liability portfolios should be updated to reflect the unwind of assumptions applicable over the period that the AOC applies based on the following information: <br> - Inflation indices used to project inflation curves should be updated to reflect experienced inflation over the year <br> - Cash balances should be adjusted to reflect the actual net impact of income earned less claims paid over the year <br> - Asset cash flow probability of default and cost of downgrade risk adjustments should be updated to reflect an alignment corresponding to the end of period factors. This reflects an unwind of the expected probability of default and downgrade experience for the lifetime of each asset |
| :--- | :--- |
| Updated Risk-Free Rate | In this step, all interest rate curves should be updated, including: <br> - The liability discount curve (including those used for commutation calculations) <br> - Asset-specific valuation risk-free curves used to calculate asset spreads <br> - Asset cash flow reference curves <br> - At this step, asset market values should be updated to reflect updates to the associated asset valuation risk-free curves and cash flow-reference curves |
| Update Starting Portfolio Asset Spreads | In this step: <br> - The spreads on each asset should be updated to the end of period spreads for the respective asset <br> - For assets for which end of period spreads are unavailable or cannot be obtained (for example, for assets that were sold or matured during the period), start of period spreads should be updated to the end of period using an appropriate index that should be described <br> - The index should be appropriate to the credit rating, asset sector and duration of each asset spread to be updated <br> - Asset market values should be updated to reflect the updated asset spreads (in addition to all other updates implemented thus far in the AOC) |
| Update Asset Portfolio | At this step: <br> - The asset portfolio should be updated to reflect the end of period asset portfolio market values and cash flows used to back the liability portfolio or block at the start of period <br> - The end of period asset portfolio should therefore reflect portfolio rebalancing impacts and the impact of the AOC steps effected thus far, unwind, curve updates, etc <br> - Assets onboarded as part of new business activities should be excluded <br> - Approximations can be used to the extent that splitting out new business impacts from legacy rebalancing impacts proves difficult to isolate-these should be stated <br> - Asset market values should be updated to reflect actual end of period asset market values. Cash flows should reflect end of period cash flows, excluding updates to assumptions underpinning the cash flow projections, such as changes to assumptions underpinning pre-payment dates <br> - For assets held throughout the period, for which the assumptions underpinning those cash flows have not changed, the updated market value should be consistent with the theoretical market value calculated as a result of the AOC updates thus far, allowing for changes in holding sizes |
| Update to Assumed Target Asset Allocation | This step should reflect updates to the reinvestment target allocation assumptions. These assumptions impact the projected asset portfolios in the SBA calculation. |


| Update to Assumed Reinvestment Spreads | This step allows for updates to the reinvestment spread assumptions. |
| :--- | :--- |
| Variation of Liabilities Cash Flows for In-force | At this step: <br> - The liability portfolio should be updated to reflect the actual end of period liability portfolio profile <br> - This should reflect the end of period liability model points (to the extent that model points are used as opposed to granular policy level modelling) <br> - This step reflects the impact of changes and differences in the start of period projected liability data profile versus the actual end of period liability data profile <br> - This step should not reflect changes in liability-related assumptions such as lapse and mortality rate assumptions |
| New Business | This step should reflect: <br> - The liability portfolio should be updated to reflect the new business liabilities onboarded during the AOC period <br> - The impact of changes to the asset portfolio as a result of new business <br> - The asset portfolio should, therefore, include updates to reflect the portion of the end of period asset portfolio that is attributable to new business liabilities <br> - Where obfuscations arise due to intra-period onboarding and subsequent portfolio-level rebalancing, assumptions and approximations made in the apportionment of the End of Period portfolio between start of period and new business assets should be stated clearly <br> - For example, where it is challenging to attribute portfolio-level rebalancing between the start of period portfolio and new business assets, a proportional apportionment could be applied |
| Change in Biting Scenario from Prior Period | This step should reflect the update to the biting scenario applicable at the end of period. The end of period biting scenario may be consistent with the start of period biting scenario. |
| Other (a)-( e) | These sections are available for insurers to use to demonstrate the impact of changes that have not been captured in previous steps. <br> Please explicitly itemise any material changes, including assumption changes, that have not already been reflected in the other line. Material changes are defined as those in excess of 5\% of the start of period BEL. <br> Possible material changes include: <br> Asset assumptions <br> Default assumptions <br> Updates to assumptions underpinning asset cash flow projections <br> Liability assumptions: <br> Lapse <br> Mortality/longevity <br> Expense <br> Please itemise any other changes that help explain the difference between the 'Change in Biting Scenario' and the 'Closing BEL'. |
| Closing BEL | The final step should equal the closing reported assets and the BEL for the current period biting scenario. |

### C.1.7 Lapse Profile

53. All insurers should complete this tab, whether they use the standard approach, SBA, or a combination of both.
54. The lapse profile tab requires the insurer to provide a detailed breakdown of the "Mass Lapse" component of the Lapse shock across its portfolio of products according to the information provided in the insurer's BSCR filing.
55. Specifically, this should use the mass lapse stress as defined in Schedule VIIA of the 2024 year-end long-term BSCR Models.
56. For each BSCR lapse category, please provide the information outlined in the table below.

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| $3 \times$ Base Lapse Rate (in \%) | Please provide a 3x base lapse rate (in \%) for each product. Where the lapse rate differs by product or term, for example, a weighted average lapse rate should be provided, and supporting information should be provided in the documentation. |
| SBA BEL (If applicable) | Aggregate SBA BEL - the total of this column should match the total SBA BEL. |
| Standard Approach BEL | Aggregate standard approach BEL - the total of this column should match the total standard approach BEL. |
| Account Value | The aggregate account value excludes any surrender charges reported under local GAAPs. |
| Cash Surrender Value | The aggregate amount that would be paid out if a policy was surrendered immediately. This should include the impact of surrender charges and Market Value Adjustments (MVAs) where applicable. |
| Required Capital without Management Actions | Aggregate mass lapse required capital, pre-diversification, without Management Actions. |
| Required Capital with Management Actions | Aggregate mass lapse required capital, pre-diversification, with management actions. |
| Prior Year Lapse/Surrender Payments | Please provide a breakdown of actual surrender payments for the year prior to the filing year. The methodology for deriving this field (for example, inferred from modelling data versus obtained from the insurer's accounting systems) should be documented, including any judgements made. |
| Current Year Lapse/Surrender Payments | Please provide a breakdown of actual surrender payments for the current year ending at the filing date. |
| Time Restraint - Normal | Please provide the average time between the request by a policyholder and the settlement under the normal course of business. The more quickly policyholders are able to access their funds, the more likely it is that insurers may have to engage in disruptive fire sales of assets to make the payments promised. |
| Time Restraint - Stressed | Please provide the average time between a policyholder's request and the settlement that the insurer believes it can reasonably extend if a mass lapse event occurs in practice. |

### C.1.8 Liquidity Projections

57. Please provide a granular breakdown of the cash flows underpinning the liquidity projections. This should be consistent with published liquidity stress testing, as disclosed, for example, in the CISSA or GSSA. All insurers should complete this tab.
58. For each cash flow, where relevant, provide the following information:

- Prior Year Actual Cash Flows - a breakdown of actual cash flows in the current year ending at the filing date. For example, for a 31 December 2024 filing date, the Prior Year Actual for 30 days would reflect the actual cash flows in the 30 days from 1 January 2024
- Projected Cash Flows - the base cash flows for the following time period as consistent with the insurer's internal plans and liquidity testing
- Projected Stressed Cash Flows - The test should be an internally defined moderate-to-severe stress

59. The 'Projected - Baseline' cash flows should reflect the best-estimate cash flows for the following year and only include known commitments. The 'Projected - Stressed' cash flows will, therefore, show the impact on the insurer's expected cashflows under stress prior to any management actions.
60. The insurer should provide a separate accompanying memo containing a projection including management actions and distinguish between those actions it can ordinarily take (e.g. reduce dividends, use contingency funding facilities already available as at the filing date) from actions that are not currently in place.
61. Outflows should be shown as a positive figure, i.e., an expense payment should be shown as a positive number.
62. The Authority expects there may be some variation in how projected cash flows are collated within different insurers, hence, there is some flexibility on how to complete this in line with internal processes.
63. A list of common cash flow types is provided, and additional cash flows that cannot be clearly mapped can be allocated to 'Other Flows'. The insurer should document how they have allocated each cash flow to the available selection.
64. Cash flows should be shown in appropriate detail to understand the drivers of liquidity. For example, it is not sufficient to simply show settlements for reinsurance transactions: the various elements of the contractual settlement should be split out into the relevant inflows and outflows.

|  | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Operating Inflows | The underlying income generated by the insurer's core business activities. It includes premiums, deposits, fees and other charges, as well as income from reinsurance recoverables. |
| Investing Inflows | The income generated from the insurer's investment activities, both in the ongoing operation of the business and as assumed after a stress event. |
| Financing Inflows | The non-operating and non-investment cash flows the insurer can access to support its business. A number of financing options are provided, depending on the facilities the insurer has available. See paragraph 63 for more details. |
| Gross Inflows | This should equal the sum of operating, investing and financing inflows. |
| Operating Outflows | The underlying outflow is generated by the insurer's core business activities. It includes benefit payments, commission payments, payments to reinsurers and the expense of running the business. |
| Investing Outflows | The costs of the insurer's investment activities, including any margin payments, collateral pledges, and assumed asset purchases, where relevant. |
| Financing Outflows | The insurer's obligations to other stakeholders. These may include any capital contributions to subsidiaries or dividend payments to a parent company or shareholder, as well as the cost of servicing existing debt or arranging new sources of credit. See paragraph 64 for more details. |
| Gross Outflows | This should equal the sum of operating, investing and financing outflows. |

Cash Flow Ratio This should equal Gross Outflows/Gross Inflows.
