## Changes to the 2025 BSCR Model

Below are the changes from the 2024 to 2025 year-end model for Long-Term insurers:

1) Regulatory submission - for the 2025 year-end and beyond, the Authority is requesting all insurers file their regulatory using the SubmIT portal at https://submit.bma.bm. If any issues or inquires with this application, please contact submit@bma.bm ;
2) Attachments - for the 2025 year-end and beyond, the Authority is requesting all insurers to include all regulatory attachments as attachments within the SubmIT portal (previously attachments were included in the BSCR model using the attach macro). This enhancement will assist in resolving data corruption and file issues encountered when attaching with the BSCR model;
3) Data Validation - the Authority has enhanced the 2025 YE return by the inclusion of a comprehensive data validation checks found on the tab "DV Dashboard" which provides a Score of the data accuracy and validation checks within the BSCR model. These checks are informative purposes only and will not prevent filing submission;
4) Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Exposure - including in the 2025 year-end model is a new schedule which the Authority is requesting insurers to complete in relation to their exposure of the new Bermuda Corporate Income Tax (if applicable);
5) Bermuda Named Rating Agencies - the Authority has updated its listing of named rating agencies, please refer to the updated listing in Insurance Handbooks in the section for 'Schedule of Fixed Income and Equity Investments by BSCR Rating';
6) Lapse, Liquidity \& Scenario Based Approach (LLSBA) template - the Authority would like to confirm that for the 2025 year-end, all long-term insurers are to complete the revised LLSBA template within the SubmIT application. The template and instructions will be made available shortly;
7) Public Disclosure of Assets and Liabilities - In December 2024, the Bermuda Monetary Authority issued a Consultation Paper entitled Proposed Enhancements to Public Disclosure Regime: Public Disclosure of Assets and Liabilities for Commercial Long-Term Insurers. The Authority is now advancing this initiative in accordance with the proposals outlined in the consultation paper.

The legislative process required to enable the collection and public disclosure of assets and liabilities information is currently being finalised. The Authority continues to target an effective date of 31 December 2025, which will require inclusion of the relevant information in the 2025 year-end filing.

The prescribed disclosure template will be published on the BMA's website during Q1 2026;

## Additional Guidance

i) Insurers that write long-term business shall select the valuation basis on the "Insurer Information" tab by choosing "Standard Approach", "Scenario-Based Approach" or "Both".
ii) "Information Sheet" tab paragraph (e) Filing Period - ensure that the filing period start date has been completed and is correct. Note that this will affect the transition rate for the BSCR calculation;
iii) "Information Sheet" tab paragraph (g) Multiplier Exchange/Translation Rate to Bermuda Dollars - ensure that the exchange rate has been completed. Note for insurers that report in currencies other than the Bermuda Dollar or United States Dollar, that the exchange rate to report is the rate to convert the figures to Bermuda Dollar / United States Dollar. For insurers reporting in Bermuda Dollar or United States Dollar, enter 1.000.
For example, if an insurer reported in Canadian Dollars with an exchange rate of CAD to BMD of 0.7657 and BMD to CAD of 1.3060 .
the exchange rate to report in paragraph ( g ) would be 0.7657
iv) "Information Sheet" tab paragraph (m)(iv) - the Authority would like to advise that in relation to paragraph (m)(iv) a qualified opinion would not include qualifications for reporting its financial statements as condensed general purpose financial statements.
v) Investment reporting - the Authority would like to remind all commercial insurers are required to provide on an unconsolidated basis their Investment by BSCR Rating on Schedule II and unconsolidated Funds Held on Schedule IIA, which reconciles to statutory balance sheet.
vi) Underwriting reporting - the Authority would like to remind all long-term insurers whom report IFRS 17 that on:
a. Schedule IV(f) Schedule of Exposure of Risk - Gross Reserves, and Claims \& Benefits Paid are to be reported on a best efforts basis using the IFRS 4 principles.
b. Schedule VII Schedule of Long-Term Insurance - Net Reserves are to be reported on a best efforts basis using the IFRS 4 principles.
