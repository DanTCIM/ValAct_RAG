## A. Background

1. The Bermuda Monetary Authority (Authority or BMA) continues to review Bermuda's regulatory and supervisory regimes, to ensure that the jurisdiction adheres to international standards and best practices for insurance regulation and supervision.
2. In 2015 and 2016, the Authority implemented changes to its regime for commercial insurers and insurance groups to enhance the statutory and prudential requirements. Updates to the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR) regime were consulted and field-tested in 2017 and 2018 and adopted on 1 January 2019 to increase the risk-sensitivity of the framework. The Authority issued two consultation papers: Proposed Enhancements to the Regulatory Regime and Fees for Commercial Insurers (CP1) in February 2023 and an updated version (CP2) in July 2023. CP2 proposed enhancements to address evolving regulatory and market developments and invited feedback from stakeholders on the proposals. The enhancements pertained to, among others, Technical Provisions, certain aspects of BSCR computation and Section 6D. After several rounds of field testing, the amendments to the Prudential Rules entered into force on 31 March 2024, and updated instructions and guidance were also published. Copies of the CP1, CP2 and the Guidance Notes, Prudential Standards, and Instructions can be found on the BMA's website.
3. Engagement with stakeholders on the proposed Lapse, Liquidity and Scenario Based Approach Return ("LLSBA") continued, and a final template was published in October 2024.
4. Based on the feedback received on the 2024 LLSBA template, the Authority revisited the content and adjusted the 2025 version. The adjustments are aimed at clarifying certain relevant concepts and facilitating efficient completion by registrants. The template and accompanying instructions can be found on the BMA's website in the reporting forms and guidelines section.
5. This document is a manual on how to complete the LLSBA template for the purposes of SBA model approval, asset approvals and year-end filings.
6. For year-end filings, insurers that use the SBA should complete all tabs. Insurers that use only the standard approach should complete the "Assets", "ALM" and the (non-optional) "Liquidity" tabs.
7. For the purpose of asset approval under the SBA, registrants should complete all asset tabs (including the "Derivatives" tab, where these are used in the SBA, and the SBA tabs "SBA_S\&R", "SBA_D\&D", and "SBA_Stress".
8. Registrants using the Standard approach and seeking approval for affiliated, related or connected assets should also complete all asset tabs, identifying those assets as such using the relevant fields in tabs, namely: "AS_Bonds_Loans", "AS_Structured", "AS_CML", "AS_RML" and "AS_Other".

References in this document to the term "insurer" shall also include reinsurers and Bermuda-based groups, unless specifically excluded.

## B. Assets

9. This section provides instructions on how to complete the LLSBA template on a column-by-column basis for the tabs relating to assets and derivatives.

The table below reflects an indicative asset class mapping from the relevant BSCR schedules to the "Lapse-Liquidity-SBA-Return Template". The mapping is only indicative and is solely intended to aid insurers in categorising assets into the LLSBA template categories. In some cases, more than one mapping may be possible depending on the specifics of the case (and any specific instructions or directions by the BMA). To avoid any doubt and for the purposes of BSCR, and especially for Schedules IIB (and IIC-IIF) that feed the capital requirement calculations, insurers are expected to perform classification based on the nature, characteristics and risks of specific assets, and in compliance with the Prudential Rules, instructions and relevant guidance.

For the purposes of LLSBA reporting, it is expected that all assets that have been reported in the asset schedules of the BSCR and/or used as part of SBA assets are included in the LLSBA template and can be mapped to the respective liability sub-portfolios, where applicable.

### B.1 Affiliated, Related and Connected Assets

11. Prior approval is required for all assets having counterparty credit exposure to an affiliate, related party or connected party. Insurers shall look through the underlying counterparties to determine whether they are affiliated, related or connected parties.
12. "Affiliated" means one company is affiliated with another company only if one of them is the subsidiary of the other, or both are subsidiaries of the same company, or each of them is controlled by the same person.
13. "Related party" means related party as defined under the respective insurer's accounting standards, namely the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) that apply in Bermuda, Canada, the United Kingdom or the US; or such other GAAP as the Authority may recognise.
14. "Connected party" means associated in any way other than those defined above, i.e., affiliated, or related, and that association could give rise to a conflict of interest in relation to the investment.

### B.2 Field Names

This section provides definitions for common field names found in the LLSBA asset tabs, sorted alphabetically.

The asset tabs consist of the following:
a. Bonds and Loans (AS_Bonds_Loans): This includes investments in a bond or a loan format in sovereign, quasi-sovereign, agency, municipal and corporate debt, including both, private and public debt;
b. Structured Assets (AS_Structured): Pre-packaged structured finance investments based on a single security, a basket of securities, options, indices, commodities, debt issuance, leases, receivables or foreign currencies or derivatives. Examples of structured assets include Commercial Mortgage-backed Securities (CMBS), Residential Mortgage-backed Securities (RMBS), Collateralised Loan Obligations (CLO), Asset-backed Securities (ABS), rated feeders, CFO notes and Collateralised Debt Obligations (CDO).
c. Commercial Mortgage Loans (AS_CML): Legally enforceable mortgages secured by a lien on commercial real estate. Commercial Real Estate (CRE) refers to property that is used for nonresidential purposes, such as (but not limited to) offices, retail space, hospitals, hotels and warehouses. These include both income-producing and high-volatility real estate.
d. Residential Mortgage Loans (AS_RML): Legally enforceable mortgages secured by a lien on residential real estate. Residential real estate consists of finished properties with the nature of a dwelling, and that satisfy all applicable laws and regulations enabling the property to be occupied for housing purposes (i.e., residential property). Residential properties with more than four units must be identified in the field 'Residential Property Type'.
e. Other assets (AS_Other): Assets that do not traditionally fit into the investment categories reported under the previous categories. Examples include hedge funds, public and private equity participations, infrastructure and project finance equity and equity in real estate interests.

### B.3 Derivatives - Aggregates

15. The tab "AS_Deriv_Agg" is used to report the aggregate exposure of all derivative positions held or controlled by the registrant, across all asset classes and derivative types. The aggregation must include all open derivative positions (whether exchange-traded or over-the-counter) as of the reporting date (T), as well as for the two preceding reporting periods (T-1 and T-2).
16. The Gross Notional Amount (GNA) represents the total notional exposure of derivatives, reported without netting across offsetting positions, to ensure the full scale of risk exposure is captured. For example, two offsetting interest rate swaps of +100 M and -100 M should be reported as 200 M in total GNA.
17. Each type of derivative should be reported separately in the following rows:
a. Interest Rate Derivatives: Includes vanilla interest rate swaps, Forward Rate Agreements (FRA), Overnight Index Swap (OIS), zero-coupon swaps, caps, floors and swaptions;
b. Currency Derivatives: Includes FX forwards, Non-deliverable Forwards (NDF), FX futures, currency swaps and FX options;
c. Equity Derivatives: Includes single-stock/index futures, equity Total Return Swap (TRS), equity options, equity-linked notes;
d. Credit Derivatives: Includes single-name/index Credit Default Swap (CDS), CDS options, credit spread options, credit TRS;
e. Longevity Derivatives: Includes longevity swaps, longevity bonds; GNA corresponds to the insured cohort's liabilities;
f. Mortality Derivatives: Includes mortality swaps, parametric mortality options, mortality-linked bonds; notional should match hedged liabilities; and
g. Other Derivatives: Includes catastrophe bonds, weather derivatives, or other risk-linked instruments not captured above.
18. Market Value (MV) or Fair Value (FV): This section captures the MV or FV of derivatives as of yearend, consistent with fair value and market-consistent principles. Reported values should reflect either mark-to-market valuations for instruments traded in active markets or mark-to-model valuations where market prices are not observable. Unlike GNA, the MV/FV may reflect netting of positive and negative positions, where appropriate under the registrant's internal or accounting framework. That is, the MV/FV reported per derivative type may represent a net asset or liability value after accounting for offsetting positions with the same counterparty or risk class, subject to applicable legal netting agreements.
19. Derivatives monthly positions: This table captures monthly derivative exposures over a 24 -month period, specifically from January 2024 through December 2025, with values reported as of month-end. The table is divided into two main sections: "GNA" and "MV/FV". Each section provides three columns: one for the total value across all derivative positions ("All") and two additional columns disaggregating the totals into positions with positive and negative values, respectively.
20. In the GNA section, the column "GNA: All" reflects the gross notional exposure of all derivative contracts outstanding at month-end, without netting of economically offsetting positions. The subsequent columns distinguish between notional amounts for positions where the derivative has a positive value (in-the-money) and those with a negative value (out-of-the-money), which may be relevant for collateral and risk management purposes.
21. The "MV/FV" section tracks the market or fair value of the same derivative positions, offering insight into the net economic exposure and valuation impact. "MV/FV: All" presents the total net fair value, while the "MV/FV: Derivatives with positive" and "MV/FV: Derivatives with negative" columns separately report the aggregate value of positions with mark-to-market gains and losses, respectively. This structure enables assessment of derivative portfolio dynamics over time, supports margin/collateral analysis, and highlights volatility or concentration in specific periods. All figures should be reported in thousands of the reporting currency.
22. Margin or collateral calls: This table records quarterly margin or collateral calls related to derivative transactions, covering the entire two calendar year periods. For each quarter, the registrant is expected to enter the monetary value (in thousands) of variation margin or initial margin paid (or received) in response to collateral requirements under derivative agreements, including those governed by Credit Support Annexes (CSA), clearinghouse arrangements or bilateral derivative contracts.
23. The value reported for each quarter should reflect the actual amount transferred or settled in cash or eligible collateral (e.g., government bonds) as a result of market movements or rebalancing. This includes both outgoing and incoming collateral flows. Positive values may denote margin posted (cash outflow from the registrant), while negative values may reflect margin received (cash inflow for the registrant). Positive and negative collateral flows should be netted.

### B.4 Derivative Open Positions

24. The tab "AS_Deriv_Open" includes active derivative positions held at the measurement date. Please include derivative pay and receive legs separately.

| Field | Description |

| Derivative Sensitivity to 1 bp Change in Underlying | Change in the value of the derivative position upon an immediate 1 bp change in the price of the underlying asset. |

### B.5 Investment and Hedging Costs

25. The tab "AS_Costs" includes, for each asset type, the total costs incurred by a registrant to manage investments and hedging activities of the insurer including asset management fees, brokerage fees and other investment related costs. Please indicate these as a proportion of the market value of the relevant asset class or subclass, considering any minimum fees and differences in fees charged for the same asset type by different asset managers. Display values in percentage (e.g., 50 basis points would be expressed as 0.5)

### B.6 Assets Disposed During the Year

26. The tab "AS_Disposed" includes the assets sold, matured or redeemed from the registrant during the current year. All disposals should be included, including asset transfers between companies within the same group. The type of disposal may be indicated in the adjacent columns.

27. The tab "AS_Mgmt" should be completed by all insurers, whether they use both SBA, Standard Approach or a combination of both.
28. Please provide a breakdown of the investment-related costs that the insurer incurs. This should include asset management fees, brokerage fees and other investment related costs, whether attributable to individual assets or not.

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Service Provider | Please specify the name of the entity that provides an asset related service to the insurer. |
| Recipient of Service | Please specify the recipient of the service. For example, the recipient of the service would normally be the insurer directly, but the holding company may pass down costs. |

| Type of Service Offered | Please select the type of service provided from the drop-down list. |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total Amount Paid Current Year | Please provide the year of reporting costs the insurer paid for this service to the service provider. |
| Total Amount Paid Prior Year | Please provide the prior year's actual costs for this service, if applicable. |

Where a service provider offers two or more services (e.g., advisory and investment management), please provide the expenses incurred for each service as a separate entry.

## C. ALM Section

29. The tab "ALM_KRD" in this section is intended to capture the interest rate risk profile of the balance sheet and its derivatives, measured through Key Rate Duration (KRD).
30. Asset and liability durations should be calculated in accordance with BSCR instructions. Liability duration should be based on the reserves reported in Form 4EBS, line 27(d), and include other liabilities such as received deposits or issued debt. For asset duration, funds held by ceding reinsurers in segregated account/trusts are to be included in the basis.

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| SBA or SA Sub-portfolio Number | If separate liability sub-portfolios exist, then the sub portfolio number reflects the identification number of each respective sub-portfolio. Assets backing each sub-portfolio should be non-fungible and individually distinguishable using the SBA sub-portfolio number. |
| Tenor | The fixed buckets (2, 5, 10, 20, 30 years) are standard reporting key rate tenors. Do not modify these unless instructed; instead, map the portfolio exposures to these points on the yield curve. |
| Assets KRD (in years) - Including Derivatives | Report the key rate duration of all asset positions after incorporating derivatives (e.g., swaps, options, forwards). This reflects the net interest rate sensitivity of assets once hedging and trading instruments are factored in. |
| Assets KRD (in years) - Excluding Derivatives | Report the key rate duration of only the physical assets (loans, bonds, etc.), before derivatives are applied. This column shows the natural exposure of the asset side of the balance sheet. |
| Liability KRD (in years) | Report the key rate duration of liabilities (technical provisions, deposits, issued debt, etc.) for each tenor bucket. This helps in assessing the assetliability duration gap at each point along the curve. |

## D. SBA section

31. This section provides instructions on how to complete the tabs relating to use of the SBA. If separate liability sub-portfolios exist, then please consider each sub portfolio individually when providing the data.

### D.1. Spread and Reinvestment

32. The following table provides further guidance on fields within the SBA Spread and Reinvestment Assumptions (SBA_S\&R) that have not been defined in another tab. Please note that the remaining headings remain the same as those defined in the Asset schedules. The information in this section relates to the existing assets and the reinvestment portfolio.

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Sellable or Unsellable | Please select whether the asset type is treated as sellable or unsellable within the SBA models. |
| Assumed Ultimate/ Strategic Allocation (SAA) (\% of SBA Portfolio) | Please provide the assumed/ expected allocation to the asset category if any exists. This may or not be the same as a reinvestment allocation whenever there is cash to be reinvested, but it might influence the reinvestment allocation directly or indirectly. <br> For the avoidance of doubt, leaving this field as blank implies that the registrant targets to maintain their Current Asset Allocation (CAA) throughout the projection period. The assumed allocation should sum to 100\% per SBA sub-portfolio. |
| Assumed Transition Period from CAA to SAA in Months | Please provide the time in months which the registrant expects it to take to ultimately have the asset mix specified in the above $S A A$. If maintaining the current asset mix, please leave blank or put a zero. |
| Reinvestment Split \% Assumption | Please provide the reinvestment allocation per asset category whenever there is cash to invest. . |
| Short Term Gross Spread (\%) | Please provide the gross short-term spread assumptions for the current asset portfolio and for reinvestment assets. If the spread assumptions for existing assets differ from the reinvestment assets, please provide separate tables for reinvestment and the current asset portfolio. |
| Long Term Gross Spread (\%) | Please provide the gross long-term spread assumptions for the current asset portfolio and for reinvestment assets. If the spread assumptions for existing assets differ from the reinvestment assets, please provide separate tables for reinvestment and current asset portfolio. |


| Short-term Spread to Long-term Spread Transition Period (in months) | Please enter the time in months over which spreads are expected to move from short-term to long-term spreads. |
| :--- | :--- |
| Investment Management Fees (\%) | Please enter the investment management fees and hedging costs per year expected to be incurred for the asset type. Please note this is as a percentage of the market value. If fees are calculated otherwise, please make it clear in the other expense related disclosures. |
| Disinvestment Rule (1\&2) | Please select the disinvestment criteria assumed when there is a cash shortfall. If there is a combination of rules followed, please select them in order of application. If there is only one disinvestment rule, please leave "Disinvestment Rule2" blank. <br> 0- Indicates that the asset is assumed to be unsellable <br> 1 and above- the asset with a lower number is prioritised when making a sale. <br> O- Asset sale rule performs an optimisation (e.g., minimise realised gains/losses) to determine which asset(s) to sell. <br> P- All assets that are sellable are sold in a proportionate manner <br> X- Other - Please use this option if a disinvestment criterion that is not in the list is used. It is expected that the rule is explained in the relevant qualitative disclosure sections. |
| Applied Haircuts (\%) | Please indicate the haircut (realised capital loss) assumed on the sale of an asset that requires the Authority's approval. |
| Transaction Costs (\%) | Please provide the transaction costs for asset purchase and asset sale. This is expected for all reinvestment assets even if they are not sellable unless the asset spreads assumptions (provided in columns "Short Term Gross Spreads" and "Long Term Gross Spreads") already reflect the transaction fees on purchase. |
| Default and Downgrade Table Applicable for the Asset | For reinvestment assets, please provide the Default and Downgrade (D\&D) cost table that the asset Group is expected to follow. Where own D\&D costs have been assumed for the asset type, please create the table and reference accordingly. |

33. This section assumes that the reinvestment strategy is static throughout the duration of the SBA projection for each SBA sub-portfolio, subject to any assumed investment mix specified. If the reinvestment strategy varies over time, then please add a commentary within the spreadsheet and the attached documentation.

### D.2 Curves

34. Please provide the following information as used in the insurer's SBA calculations.

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| UFR | Enter the Ultimate Forward Rate (UFR) for extending the Risk Free Rate (RFR), and the maximum number of years the curve is extended. |
| Risk Free Rate | Please provide the discount factors implied by the RFR curve. The risk-free curve used in the SBA calculations shall be either: <br> - The RFR curve published or directed by the BMA; or <br> - The relevant RFR market curve with no adjustments. <br> The relevant RFRs referred to in the second bullet shall correspond either to the government bond rates or the swap rates, depending on the currency and the generally accepted market practices regarding risk-free benchmark rates for that currency. (For more details, refer to Section E9 of the 2025 Instructions Handbook.) |
| Reference Rate Curves for Other Instruments | Enter the discount factors implied by each of the other reference curves used in either the valuation of assets or for the determination of asset cashflow projections. <br> Curves used for asset valuation should include those used to calculate the stated valuation spread for the respective asset if this differs from the RFR curve already specified. <br> Curves used to determine the projected cashflows should reflect the reference curves used to determine floating rate coupon values. This should include interest rate curves as well as inflation and Limited Price Indexation (LPI) curves. <br> Where asset cash flows are linked to different LPI compositions, a curve should be provided for each composition required. |

### D.3. Liability Cashflows

35. Please provide the cashflow profile for each SBA sub portfolios (blocks of business), as used in the SBA calculations. Cashflows should be provided vertically, so each new sub-portfolio will start below the previous one - see cells A13 and A867 for an example. Copy and paste additional tables as required.
36. Fungible blocks or where BMA fungibility approval has been granted can be provided as one sub portfolio. However, if a registrant models two sub-portfolios distinctly and later assumes fungibility, it is expected that the cashflows would be provided separately as well.

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Cashflow Inflow | Please provide a simple description or formula of the inflows assumed in the calculation of the Best Estimate Liability (BEL) (e.g., premiums, fees). Please note that only cash inflows from the policies within the sub-portfolio are expected to be included in this section (i.e., no asset cash flows are to be included in this section. In the descriptions table, please specify what policy inflows have been included. |
| Cashflow Outflow | Please provide a simple description or formula of the outflows assumed in the calculation of the BEL (e.g., claims, expenses). |
| Cashflow Inflow Amount | For each scenario and each sub-portfolio, please provide the liability cashflow inflow for each time period. |
| Cashflow Outflow Amount | For each scenario and each sub-portfolio, please provide the liability cashflow outflow for each time period. Outflows should be shown as a positive number. |
| Total SBA Model Liability Cashflow Amount | Cashflow inflow amount minus cash flow outflow amount |

### D.4 Default and Downgrade Cost

37. The "SBA_D\&D" tab should be completed to indicate the default and downgrade tables used for each asset type within the SBA calculation. Rows 9 through 34 should be used to indicate the SBA asset type in column B, and the default and downgrade tables in column C.
38. The default and downgrade tables provided by the BMA are shown in rows 35 downwards for the following:

- $1^{\text {st }}$ Lien Bank Loans
- Other Bank Loans
- Secured Bonds
- Senior Unsecured Bonds
- Subordinated Bonds

39. Additional tables may be added under these tables if approved by the BMA, including cases where the registrant determined that their own view was more conservative.
40. The application for default and downgrade costs shall be included as part of the asset application, including all the supporting analysis. This should demonstrate the insurer's internal view of default and downgrade costs. For example, the default and downgrade costs for structured assets and mortgage loans shall be included in the application for structured assets and mortgage loans, respectively.
41. The default and downgrade tables provide Expected Loss from Default and Cost of Downgrade for different BSCR ratings (columns C to J) for tenors between one and 20 years. For tenors beyond 20 years, the 20-year value should be used

### D.5 Stress

Please provide the results of stress and sensitivity testing as indicated in this section.

### D.6 Analysis of Change

42. An Analysis of Change is an important control to help insurers validate their key metrics and understand the drivers of the movement in a metric from one time period to the next.
43. In the case of the SBA, the Authority requires insurers to provide a detailed analysis of change for a) the SBA BEL for the biting scenario; and b) the implied SBA Spread relative to the underlying RFR.
44. Commentary capturing the key reasons for any movement should be provided. For example, if there have been several model changes, the commentary should articulate which particular changes contributed materially to the observed impact for that step.
45. An Analysis of Change should be performed individually for each sub-portfolio that represents a material exposure to the insurer, up to a maximum of ten.
46. "Material exposure" should be determined by the insurer in an appropriate manner that is documented. This recognises that using the BEL to determine the 'largest' sub-portfolios may not always be suitable. For example, a general account product with a low BEL but high Sum Assured could be considered material within the insurer's risk management framework and, in this example, should be included even if it has a lower BEL than other products.
47. If there are more than ten sub-portfolios, or if more than one sub-portfolio is demonstrably small, subportfolios may be combined in the 'Aggregate of all other small portfolios' row. The justification should be documented.
48. The Authority recognises that the order of the steps prescribed below in the table entitled "SBA_Analysis_of_Change" may differ from that of the insurer's internal process. If this is the case, the insurer should state the differences in the order of steps and provide commentary on how this affects the allocation of movement in the accompanying documentation.
49. The Authority expects most of the analysis to be performed using model runs, rather than estimates. If an estimate is used for any of the steps, the insurer should describe how the calculation was made and justify why this is appropriate in the accompanying documentation.
50. The expectation is that an insurer's processes will automatically produce an analysis of change for each sub-portfolio in line with the required steps outlined in the table below. However, the steps may be simplified for less material sub-portfolios as long as the analysis remains appropriate and information is not lost.
51. Similarly, an Analysis of Change inevitably requires some judgement, particularly for the steps following the "Updated Risk Free Rate" step. It would not be practical to provide an exhaustive list of instructions on how to adjust for every scenario that might arise. While the instructions in the table below provide information on how each step should be considered, it is recognised that judgement may be required.
52. The over-arching expectation is that the overall analysis of the drivers of the change in BEL and SBA Spread will provide an 'allocation of impacts' that can be articulated and justified within the insurer's governance system and other stakeholders.
53. The Analysis of Change would normally be an annual exercise. However, for the first year of implementing the SBA, the insurer should discuss with the BMA whether an interim Analysis of Change would be appropriate. For example, if Q2 figures were reported to the BMA using the SBA, a Q2-toQ4 analysis would normally be required.
54. For year-end 2025 reporting, the BMA acknowledges that insurers may have to build the necessary tools and processes to complete this tab as expected; therefore, a 'best endeavour' approach is encouraged.

Completion of "SBA_AoC" tab

For the avoidance of doubt, BEL excludes the LapC adjustment.

| SBA_Analysis_of_Change (AoC) |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Field | Description |
| Description of Products | For each sub-portfolio, describe the main product(s). |
| BEL - Base Scenario | State the base Closing BEL for each sub-portfolio |
| BEL - Scenario | State the Closing BEL for each of the eight interest rate scenarios, for each subportfolio |
| BEL (after AoC step) | Calculated BEL having made all the changes up to, and including each AoC step |
| Implied SBA Spread | Implied SBA Spread, relative to the firm's RFR set out in C1.1, for each AoC step |
| Step | Description |
| Prior period (start) | The prior period's Closing BE. In the biting scenario - this would normally be as reported at the prior period end |
| Model Changes | The BEL as valued at the prior period's start, allowing for changes in the methodology that impact the BEL calculation, including both asset and liability methodology changes. Please include assumption changes in this step and itemise the impact of any material assumption changes (defined as 5\% or greater of start of period BEL) in the 'Other' section below. |
| Unwind | At this stage, the following should occur: <br> - The Asset and Liability Portfolios should be rolled-forward as per the following: <br> - The valuation/calculation date should be updated to reflect the End of Period Date <br> - All curves used within the model (both interest rate and inflation rate curves) should be rolled forward to reflect the change in date <br> - Spot Interest Rate curves should be recalculated as at the End of Period Date using the Forward Rates implied by the Start of Period Spot Curves |


|  | - Discount Rates should be calculated using the appropriate rolledforward spot interest rate curves <br> - Inflation Curves should be rolled forward by rebasing the projected inflation using the Start of Period projected inflation index. This implies that there will be no changes to inflation expectations <br> - There should be no change to the asset and liability cash flows, with the exception of the cashflows that are projected to occur over the year in which the AoC applies, fall away <br> - Cash balances should reflect the net impact of the asset and liability cash flows dropped due to the date update <br> - Asset Market Values should be rolled forward to reflect the change in promised cash flows and impact of rolling cashflow indices (interest rate reference curves and inflation index curves) forward. <br> - At this stage, there should be no change to the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) calculated for each asset at the End of Period Date versus the Start of Period Date. This should be demonstrated by calculating the Asset Portfolio IRR before and after the above stated Roll-forward updates <br> - The Asset and Liability Portfolios should be updated to reflect the unwind of assumptions applicable over the period to which the AoC applies as per the following: <br> - The inflation indices used to project inflation curves should be updated to reflect experienced inflation over the year <br> - Cash balances should be adjusted to reflect the actual net impact of income earned less claims paid over the year <br> - Asset Cashflow Probability of Default and Cost of Downgrade risk adjustments should be updated to align with the End of Period factors. This reflects an unwind of the expected probability of default and downgrade experience for the lifetime of each asset |
| :--- | :--- |
| Updated Risk Free Rate | In this step, all interest rate curves should be updated, including: <br> - The liability discount curve (including those used for commutation calculations) <br> - Asset-specific Valuation Risk-Free Curves used to calculate asset spreads <br> - Asset Cashflow Reference Curves <br> - Asset Market Values should be updated to reflect any changes to the associated Asset Valuation Risk-Free Curves and Cashflow Reference Curves |
| Update Starting Portfolio Asset Spreads | In this step, the following should occur: <br> - The spreads on each asset should be updated to the End of Period spreads for the respective asset <br> - Any assets for which end of period spreads are not available or cannot be obtained (such as assets that were sold or matured during the period) should have their Start of Period spreads updated to the End of Period. For this, an appropriate index should be used and described <br> - The index should be appropriate for the credit rating, asset sector and duration of each asset spread to be updated <br> - Asset Market Values should be updated to reflect the updated asset spreads (in addition to all other updates implemented thus far in the AoC) |
| Update Asset Portfolio |  |


|  | In this step, the following should occur: <br> - The asset portfolio should be updated to reflect the End of Period asset portfolio market values and cashflows used to back the liability portfolio or block at the Start of the Period <br> - The End of Period asset portfolio should, therefore, reflect portfolio rebalancing impacts as well as the impact of the AoC steps affected thus far such as unwind, curve updates, etc. <br> - Assets onboarded as part of new business activities should be excluded <br> - To the extent that splitting out new business impacts from legacy rebalancing impacts is difficult to isolate, approximations can be used and stated <br> - Asset Market Values should be updated to reflect actual End of Period Asset Market Values. Cashflows should reflect End of Period Cashflows, excluding updates to any assumptions underpinning the cash flow projections, such as changes to pre-payment dates. <br> - For assets held throughout the period in which the assumptions underpinning those cashflows have not changed, the updated market value should be consistent with the theoretical market value that is calculated as a result of the AoC updates thus far, allowing for changes in holding sizes |
| :--- | :--- |
| Update to Assumed Target Asset Allocation | This step should reflect updates to the reinvestment target allocation assumptions. These assumptions impact the projected asset portfolios in the SBA calculation. |
| Update to Assumed Reinvestment Spreads | This step allows for updates to the Reinvestment Spread assumptions. |
| Variation of Liabilities Cashflows for In-force | In this step, the following should occur: <br> - The liability portfolio should be updated to reflect the actual End of Period liability portfolio profile. This should reflect End of Period liability model points (to the extent that model points are used as opposed to granular policy level modelling) <br> - This step should reflect the impact of any changes and differences at the Start of Period projected liability data profile versus the actual End of Period liability data profile <br> - Changes in liability-related assumptions such as lapse and mortality rate assumptions should not be reflect reflected |
| New Business | This step should reflect the following: <br> : <br> - The Liability Portfolio should be updated to reflect the New Business liabilities onboarded during the AoC period <br> - The impact of changes to the asset portfolio as a result of new business should be included <br> - The asset portfolio should, therefore, include new business and be updated to reflect the portion of the End of Period asset portfolio that is attributable to new business liabilities <br> - Where obfuscations arise due to intra-period onboarding and subsequent portfolio level rebalancing, assumptions and approximations made in the apportionment of the End of Period portfolio between Start of Period and New Business assets should be stated clearly. For example, it is difficult to attribute portfolio level rebalancing between the Start of Period portfolio and New Business Assets, a proportional apportionment could be applied |


| Change in Biting Scenario from Prior Period | This step should reflect the update to the Biting Scenario applicable at the End of Period. The End of Period Biting Scenario may be consistent with the Start of Period Biting Scenario. |
| :--- | :--- |
| Other (a)-( e) | Insurers should use this section to demonstrate the impact of any changes that have not been captured in the previous steps. <br> Please explicitly itemise any material changes, including assumption changes, not already reflected in the "Other" line. Material Changes are defined as those in excess of $5 \%$ of the Start of Period BEL. <br> Possible material changes include: <br> - Asset Assumptions: <br> - Default Assumptions <br> - Updates to assumptions underpinning asset cashflow projections. <br> - Liability Assumptions: <br> - Lapse <br> - Mortality / longevity <br> - Expense <br> Please itemise any other changes that help explain the difference between the 'Change in Biting Scenario' and the 'Closing BEL'. |
| Closing BEL | The final step should equal the closing reported Assets and BEL, on the Current Period Biting Scenario. |

## F. Liquidity Section

### F.1 Lapse Profile

56. This tab should be completed by all insurers, whether they use the SBA, the Standard Approach or a combination of both methods.
57. The Lapse Profile tab requires the insurer to provide a detailed breakdown of the "Mass lapse" component of the Lapse shock across the insurer's portfolio of products, in line with the information provided in the insurer's BSCR filing.
58. Specifically, this should use the Mass Lapse stress as defined in Schedule VIIA of the 2025 year-end long-term BSCR Models. The following data rows should be reported for the whole portfolio and all regions:

- E.NR: Non-Retail products with no lapse risk exposure
- E.R: Retail products with no lapse risk exposure
- Z. All: All products in all regions - For this row, include all products in all regions, including all data rows above. All products/regions should be weighted for purposes of this data row by their BEL (SA+SBA)

59. For each BSCR Lapse Category, please provide the information outlined in the table below.

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 3 x Base lapse rate (in \%) | Please provide 3x Base lapse rate (in \%) for each product. Where the lapse rate differs, for example, by product or term, then a weighted average lapse rate should be provided. Supporting information should be provided in the documentation. |
| SBA BEL (If applicable) | Aggregate SBA BEL - the total of this column should match the total SBA BEL Values are required for both the current reporting year and for the prior reporting year. For example: <br> - If your current reporting year ends at year-end 2025, for the current year provide data for the reporting period 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025. For the prior year, provide data for the reporting period 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2024 <br> - If your current reporting year ends at the end of March 2025, for the current year, provide data for the reporting period 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025. For the prior year, provide data for the reporting period 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. For other reporting/fiscal years, please adjust accordingly. |
| Standard Approach BEL | Aggregate Standard Approach BEL - the total of this column should match the total Standard Approach BEL |


|  | Values are required for both the current and prior reporting years. For example: <br> - If your current reporting year ends at year-end 2025, for the current year, provide data for the reporting period 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2025. For the prior year, provide data for the reporting period 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2024. <br> - If your current reporting year ends at March-end 2025, for the current year, provide data for the reporting period 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025. For the prior year, provide data for the reporting period 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. For other reporting/fiscal years, please adjust accordingly. |
| :--- | :--- |
| Account value | The aggregate account value, excluding any surrender charges as reported under local GAAPs |
| Cash Surrender Value | The aggregate amount that would be paid out if a policy were surrendered immediately. This should include the impact of surrender charges and MVAs where applicable |
| Required Capital without Management Actions | Aggregate Mass Lapse required capital, pre-diversification, without Management Actions |
| Required Capital with Management Actions | Aggregate Mass Lapse required capital, pre-diversification, with Management Actions |
| Prior Year Lapse/Surrender Payments | Please provide a breakdown of actual surrender payments for the year prior to the filing year. <br> The methodology for deriving this field (for example, inferred from modelling data, or obtained from the insurer's accounting systems) should be documented, including any judgements made. |
| Current Year Lapse/Surrender Payments | Please provide a breakdown of actual surrender payments for the current year ending at the filing date. |
| Time Restraint - Normal | Please provide the average time between the request by a policyholder and the settlement under the normal course of business. The more quickly policyholders can access their funds, the more likely it is that insurers may have to engage in disruptive fire sales of assets to make the payments promised. |
| Time Restraint - Stressed | Please provide the average time between the request by a policyholder and the settlement that the insurer believes they can reasonably extend if a mass lapse event occurred in practice. |

### F.2 Liquidity Projections

60. Please provide a granular breakdown of the cashflows underpinning the liquidity projections. This should be consistent with published liquidity stress testing, as disclosed, for example, in the CISSA or GSSA. All insurers should complete this tab.
61. For each cashflow, where relevant, provide the following:

- Prior Year Actual Cashflows: Breakdown of actual cashflows in the current year ending at the filing date. For example, for a 31 December 2025 filing date, the Prior Year Actual for 30 days would reflect the actual cashflows in the 30 days from 2 December 2025
- Projected: Base Cashflows for the following time period as consistent with the insurer's internal plans and liquidity testing; the projected cashflows should be proportionally aligned with the prior year's actual cashflows to ensure plausibility of projections
- Projected Stressed Cashflows: The test should be an internally defined moderate-to-severe liquidity stress. Two sets of stressed cashflows are required, with different time horizons, for a slow-moving liquidity stress scenario (e.g., a scenario with high funding costs exceeding yields on assets) and for a fast-moving liquidity stress scenario (e.g., mass lapse shocks). Provide a detailed description of the used internal stress test scenarios in columns U and V.

62. Outflows should be shown as a positive figure, i.e., an expense payment should be shown as a positive number.
63. The Authority expects there may be some variation in how projected cashflows are collated within different insurers, hence there is some flexibility on how to complete this in line with internal processes.
64. A list of common cashflow types is provided, and additional cashflows that cannot be clearly mapped can be allocated to "Other Flows". The insurer should document how they have allocated each cashflow to the available selection.
65. Cashflows should be shown at an appropriate level of detail to understand the drivers of liquidity. For example, it is not sufficient to simply show settlements for reinsurance transactions: the various elements of the contractual settlement should be split out into the relevant inflows and outflows.

|  | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Operating Inflows | Operating Inflows represents the underlying income generated by the insurer's core business activities, and includes Premiums, Deposits, Fees and other Charges, as well as income from reinsurance recoverables. |

| Gross Outflows | This should equal the sum of Operating, Investing and Financing Outflows. |


| Cashflow Ratio | This should equal Gross Outflows/Gross Inflows. |
| :--- | :--- |

66. Financing Inflows should be separated by type of financing using the table below. Where more than one of a particular category is used, the supporting memo should provide details of the different underlying sources that have been aggregated.

### F.3 Liquidity Sources (optional or on request)

68. Registrants are encouraged to complete this sheet on a best-effort basis, reflecting their internal liquidity monitoring practices and frameworks. While submission of this data is not mandatory, it may be requested by the Authority as part of ongoing or ad-hoc supervisory reviews to support a more comprehensive understanding of the registrant's liquidity profile.
69. Registrants are requested to report the haircuts applied to various liquidity sources as used in their own liquidity measurement and monitoring framework, across three distinct time horizons:

- One Week (1W): Reflecting short-term liquidity stress scenarios or immediate cash needs, such as in a 1-in-200 fast-moving event (e.g., mass lapse, collateral calls, market freeze)
- Three Months (3M): Reflecting a medium-term liquidity planning horizon, where insurers have some flexibility but market conditions may remain volatile or partially impaired
- One Year (1Y): Reflecting a long-term horizon under more orderly conditions, where the insurer may plan gradual asset sales, reinvestment strategies, or natural run-off of liabilities

70. Definition of Haircut: A haircut is the percentage discount applied to the reported value (e.g., market or par value) of an asset to reflect the expected loss of value or lack of immediate convertibility in a stressed or time-constrained sale. Haircuts capture risk factors such as bid/ask spreads, market depth, price volatility, encumbrance, settlement timing, and counterparty exposure.
71. Reporting Expectations: Haircuts should be reported in percentage terms (\%), representing the assumed reduction in asset value under each horizon. Haircuts should reflect the registrant's own liquidity risk assessment practices, not standardised supervisory values. If no haircut is applied to an asset class, report " $0 \%$ " and be prepared to justify this assumption upon request.
72. Assets that are excluded from the liquidity sources should get $100 \%$ haircut. The assets not held should be marked "N/A".
73. Consistent with the approach used in other LLSBA sheets, registrants are instructed to report haircut and liquidity metrics data solely in respect of the general account. Unit-linked products, separate accounts and any legally segregated portfolios must be excluded from the reported values, as these are typically ring-fenced and not available for general liquidity management. Where legal ownership, operational segregation or policyholder direction limits the use of such assets, they must not be included in the haircut table.
74. Haircuts must be provided for the explicit and pre-defined asset classes listed in the template. No residual "Other" or catch-all category is included in this sheet. Registrants are expected to map all assets held within the liquidity buffer to the appropriate categories provided and should not aggregate dissimilar assets or report blended haircuts across multiple classes. Where an asset class does not apply or is not held, the relevant row may be left blank or marked "N/A".
75. The "Own liquidity metrics" section of this sheet is intended to capture the liquidity metrics, sources, thresholds and limits that the registrant applies within its own internal liquidity risk measurement and
monitoring framework. All reported values should reflect the registrant's internal view of liquidity under stress and must relate exclusively to the general account, excluding unit-linked products, separate accounts, and other legally segregated portfolios. Where internal liquidity frameworks consider ringfenced portfolios, these should be excluded or clearly identified as out of scope.
76. Registrants must report the total liquidity sources available under their internal methodology, after considering the impact of any internally applied haircut as reported in the table above. A separate row is provided to disclose the portion of liquidity sourced from affiliated, related, or connected counterparties, as such assets may be treated differently from a supervisory standpoint.
77. The table also requests the total liquidity needs as measured under the registrant's own internal stresstesting assumptions or liquidity metrics. This may include expected policyholder cash outflows, operational expenses, derivative collateral requirements, or other modelled stress-driven obligations. The metric should reflect the firm's definition of a stressed yet plausible scenario, consistent with its internal risk appetite and contingency planning horizon.
78. Where applicable, registrants should report their internal liquidity coverage ratio (i.e., liquidity sources divided by liquidity needs), expressed as a percentage. Additionally, any excess liquidity - defined as the surplus of liquidity sources over modelled needs - should be reported in monetary units (e.g., USD thousands). If the registrant defines internal thresholds or early warning indicators, these should be provided as well. The "red limit" typically denotes a breach point that requires senior management or board-level escalation, while the "orange" or "amber" limit typically indicates an early warning zone where enhanced monitoring or contingency activation may begin.
79. Registrants should also specify the stress level used to calibrate their internal liquidity assumptions and haircuts. For example, the firm may state that its internal liquidity metrics are designed to withstand a 1-in-200 event over a one-week horizon or are aligned with a $99.5 \%$ confidence interval. If multiple levels are used across different metrics, the most relevant value for group-level liquidity management should be disclosed.
80. Finally, the table includes a row for the internal liquidity coverage ratio excluding affiliate-related assets. This version of the ratio helps the Authority assess the quality and independence of the liquidity buffer, particularly in stress scenarios where group-level liquidity support may not be immediately fungible or contractually available.
81. Where no internal threshold exists for a specific item (e.g., no amber limit or no explicit PML calibration), registrants may indicate "N/A." All data should be consistent with the most recent internal liquidity reports submitted to senior management or internal risk committees. The Authority may request supplementary documentation, such as Liquidity Contingency Plans, internal stress testing memos, or ALCO materials, to verify the reported values.
82. Encumbered and Pledged Assets - Total Amount at Year-End: Report the total nominal or market value of all assets that are legally or contractually encumbered as of the end of each reporting period, covering:

- The current reporting year
- The two preceding reporting years (i.e., a rolling three-year view.

83. Encumbered assets are those pledged or tied up through mechanisms such as:

- Repurchase agreements (repos)
- Securities lending
- Collateral posting (e.g., under derivative Credit Support Annexes or margin requirements)
- Secured funding transactions, including but not limited to Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, structured lending or covered bond programmes
- Any other arrangements where assets are no longer freely available for liquidity use

84. These values provide the Authority with insight into how much of the balance sheet is subject to encumbrance and unavailable for immediate liquidity management. For example, for a submission in the 2025 reporting cycle, data must be provided for:

- 2023 (prior year 2)
- 2024 (prior year 1)
- 2025 (current year-end reporting date)

85. All figures should be reported in the standard units and currency defined in the LLSBA template. If both nominal and market values are available internally, the market value is preferred, as it provides a better basis for comparison with haircut and collateralisation metrics. If only nominal values are used, this should be footnoted or annotated.
86. Report a breakdown of the total encumbered and pledged assets at year-end, categorised by the underlying asset class and credit quality, consistent with the registrant's internal classification and external credit ratings where applicable. The purpose of this section is to assess the liquidity characteristics and quality of collateral assets tied up in encumbered structures.
87. Asset categorisation should be based primarily on external credit ratings from recognised rating agencies (e.g., S\&P, Moody's, Fitch), unless internal ratings are more appropriate and consistently used in the registrant's collateral or liquidity management framework. If internal ratings are used, this must be clearly disclosed. The following categories must be used:

- Government, municipal and international bonds with ratings AAA to A: This includes highquality sovereign, supranational, and agency securities eligible as top-tier collateral
- Other government, municipal and international bonds: Includes those rated below A or unrated, which may still be encumbered but may have lower market liquidity or higher haircut requirements
- Corporate bonds with ratings AAA, AA, and A: High-quality corporate debt is often eligible for secured funding transactions with moderate haircuts
- Corporate bonds with rating BBB: Investment-grade, but lower-quality corporate bonds. These may still be encumbered, but typically attract higher haircuts
- Corporate bonds with a rating below BBB: Includes high-yield or non-investment grade bonds (BB or lower) and may present significantly higher liquidity and credit risk under stress scenarios
- Others: Capture any encumbered assets that do not fall into the fixed income categories above, such as:
- Equities (public or private)
- Securitised assets (e.g., RMBS, CMBS, CLOs)
- Commercial or residential mortgages
- Private credit or loans
- Alternative assets used as collateral

88. Capacity of Assets that Can Be Encumbered or Pledged at Year-End: This section requires registrants to report the value of unencumbered assets held as of year-end that are legally and operationally eligible to be pledged or used as collateral in future secured funding or margining transactions. These assets must be available for encumbrance under existing legal frameworks, operational readiness (e.g., settlement system connectivity), and to satisfy the eligibility requirements of potential counterparties such as repo markets, central banks, clearing houses, or derivative counterparties.
89. Assets should not be reported in this section if:

- They are already encumbered or pledged (these should be reported in the previous section)
- They are contractually restricted (e.g., ring-fenced, trust-held)
- They are ineligible for secured transactions due to their type, quality, legal structure or lack of documentation

90. The classification of assets should follow the same asset class categories used in the previous section ("Asset Class Composition of Encumbered and Pledged Assets"), namely:

- Government, municipal and international bonds with ratings AAA to A
- Other government, municipal and international bonds (below A or unrated)
- Corporate bonds with ratings AAA, AA, and A
- Corporate bonds with rating BBB
- Corporate bonds with a rating below BBB
- Others: e.g., equities, securitised assets, mortgage loans, private debt, or alternatives - only if eligible and feasible to pledge under standard market practices

91. This section provides visibility into the registrant's available capacity to raise secured funding in stress scenarios by leveraging unencumbered but eligible assets and supports the analysis of potential liquidity uplift from unused collateral resources.
92. Maturity Profile of Encumbered and Pledged Assets: This section captures the residual maturity profile of assets that are encumbered or pledged as of year-end, based on the contractual or operational maturity of the associated encumbrance. Registrants must report the value of encumbered assets, grouped by the transaction's remaining maturity (e.g., repo term, collateral agreement reset date, loan term). Understanding the maturity structure of encumbered positions is essential for evaluating how quickly liquidity may be released under stress or as part of contingency planning. It also provides insight into rollover risk, refinancing pressures, and liquidity horizon mismatches. The following maturity categories must be used:

- Overnight $(\mathrm{O} / \mathrm{N})$ : Transactions that settle and mature or reset on the next business day, including overnight repos and margining agreements that are renewed daily
- One week and less (excluding O/N):Transactions with a contractual maturity longer than overnight but no more than one calendar week
- Greater than 1 week and less than or equal to 1 month ( $>1 \mathrm{~W}$ and $\leq 1 \mathrm{M}$ ): Includes encumbering transactions with a remaining maturity of more than seven days and up to 31 days
- Other: Captures all other remaining maturities, including:
- Long-dated or evergreen collateral agreements (e.g., certain Credit Support Annexes)
- Open-term secured lending
- Multi-month or multi-year term repos
- Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances or similar programmes

93. Report values in thousands of the reporting currency (e.g., USD, CHF, EUR) and include data for the current reporting year and the two preceding years (e.g., 2023, 2024, 2025). If market value and nominal values differ significantly, market value is preferred, provided that it is consistently applied across all maturity buckets. If encumbered assets span multiple maturity categories (e.g., in pooled or crosscollateralized arrangements), registrants should allocate based on the dominant contractual term or use a reasonable internal methodology, which may be subject to supervisory review.
94. Haircut Rates and Yields (in \%) - Weighted Averages: This section requires registrants to report two key metrics related to the cost and efficiency of encumbered assets over the reporting period: the weighted average haircut rate and the weighted average annualised yield (or cost of funding). These values provide insight into the economic terms under which the registrant accesses liquidity via secured funding, collateral posting, or similar encumbrance mechanisms.
95. Weighted Average Haircut Rate (in \%): The haircut rate represents the average percentage reduction in collateral value applied when assets are pledged. It reflects the collateral valuation haircut faced by the registrant and is a critical metric for understanding the amount of excess collateral required to support funding or margining needs. The haircut should be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\text { Haircut }=1-\left(\frac{\text { Cash received or credit exposure covered }}{\text { Asset value posted }}\right)
$$

96. This ratio should be computed as a weighted average across all encumbered transactions, with weights based on asset volumes or exposure amounts. Haircuts must be expressed as a percentage rounded to two decimal places (e.g., 7.50\%).
97. Weighted Average Annualised Yield (in \%): This figure represents the average cost of funding or synthetic yield associated with the encumbered assets, on an annualised basis. It includes:

- Repo funding rates
- Securities lending spreads
- Interest or fee charges on collateralised borrowing
- Synthetic costs embedded in derivative-linked collateral arrangements (e.g., CSAs)

98. The rate should be calculated across all relevant transactions weighted by the notional or market value of encumbered assets. Report the result as an annualised percentage, rounded to two decimal places (e.g., 2.35\%). The Weighted Average Annualised Yield formula:

$$
\text { Weighted Average Yield }=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\text { Yield }_{i} \times \text { Amount }_{i}\right)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text { Amount }_{i}}
$$
