    * (i) the ratio of the sum of capital and surplus to the total admitted assets is at least equal to.10;
    * (ii) the ratio of the sum of the reserves and liabilities for annuities and deposits to the total admitted assets is less than.30;

For example, to determine whether an actuarial opinion and memorandum is required for the 1994 year end under this test, the actuary should look at the examiner designation made in 1993 and 1994 generally based on the 1992 and 1993 year end data.

    * (iii) the ratio of the book value of the noninvestment grade bonds to the sum of the capital and surplus is less than.50; and
    * (iv) the examiner team for the NAIC has not designated the company as a first priority company in any of the two calendar years coincident with and immediately preceding the calendar year end for which the actuarial opinion is applicable, or a second priority company in each of the two calendar years coincident with and immediately preceding the calendar year end for which the actuarial opinion is applicable, or the company has resolved the first or second priority status to the satisfaction of the insurance regulator of the state of domicile and such insurance regulator has so notified the chair of the NAIC Life and Actuarial Task Force and the NAIC Staff and Support Office. Note: when the examiner team in the spring of a calendar year designates a priority, such designation is generally based on the preceding year. For example, to determine whether an actuarial opinion and memorandum is required for the 1994 year end under this test, the actuary should look at the examiner designation made in 1993 and 1994 generally based on the 1992 and 1993 year end data.

    * (v) To my knowledge, based on such inquiry as I considered reasonable, there is not a specific request from the insurance regulator in any jurisdiction in which the company does business requiring an asset adequacy analysis opinion.”
8. The concluding paragraph may state purposes for which the opinion is rendered, for example:
    "This opinion is prepared for the use of company management and the New York Department of Financial Services for the purposes set forth in New York Insurance Law § 4217 and 11 NYCRR 95 (Insurance Regulation 126). This opinion covers business in force as of December 31, 20[ ] and does not cover new business issued subsequent to this date.
    Signature of Appointed Actuary.
    Address of Appointed Actuary.
    Telephone Number of Appointed Actuary.
    Date Opinion is Signed.”
9. If there has been any change in the actuarial assumptions from those previously employed, that change should be described in the annual statement and in a paragraph of the statement of actuarial opinion, and the reference in subparagraph (6)(iv) of this subdivision to consistency should read as follows:
    “. . . with the exception of the change described on Page [ ] of the annual statement (or in a separate paragraph in this opinion).”
The adoption for new issues or new claims or other new liabilities of an actuarial assumption which differs from a corresponding assumption used for prior new issues or new claims or other new liabilities is not a change in actuarial assumptions within the meaning of this paragraph.
10. If the appointed actuary is unable to form an opinion, he or she shall refuse to issue a statement of actuarial opinion. If the appointed actuary's opinion is adverse or qualified, he or she shall issue an adverse or qualified actuarial opinion explicitly stating the reasons for such opinion. Any statements for any adverse or qualified actuarial opinion should follow the scope paragraph and precede the opinion paragraph.
11. If the appointed actuary does not express an opinion as to the accuracy and completeness of the listings and summaries of policies in force, there shall be attached to the opinion the statement of a company officer or accounting firm who prepared such underlying data similar to the following:
    "I [name of officer], [title] of [name and address of company or accounting firm], hereby affirm that the listings and summaries of policies and contracts in force as of December 31, [ ], prepared for and submitted to [name of appointed actuary], were prepared under my direction and, to the best of my knowledge and belief, are substantially accurate and complete.

### (b) Recommended language.
The following language provided is that which in typical circumstances would be included in a statement of actuarial opinion in accordance with this section. The language may be modified as needed to meet the circumstances of a particular case, but the appointed actuary should use language which clearly expresses his or her professional judgment.

In other respects, my examination included such review of the actuarial assumptions and actuarial methods used and such tests of the calculations as I considered necessary and I am so satisfied as to their reasonableness and consistency.”
Such a section must be accompanied by a statement by each person relied upon in the form prescribed by paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
6) The opinion statement shall include a statement such as the following:
    “In my opinion the reserves and related actuarial values concerning the statement items identified above:
    * (i) Are computed in accordance with those presently accepted actuarial standards of practice that specifically relate to the opinion required under section 95.8 of New York Insurance Regulation 126 to the extent not inconsistent therewith and in accordance with the requirements of such regulation, and that are consistently applied and fairly stated, in accordance with sound actuarial principles;
    * (ii) Are based on actuarial assumptions which produce reserves at least as great as those called for in any contract provision as to reserve basis and method, and are in accordance with all other contract provisions;

    The actuarial methods, considerations and analyses used in forming my opinion conform to the appropriate Standards of Practice as promulgated by the Actuarial Standards Board, to the extent not inconsistent with Insurance Regulation 126 and conform to the requirements of such regulation.
    This opinion is updated annually as required by statute. To the best of my knowledge, there have been no material changes from the applicable date of the annual statement to the date of the rendering of this opinion which should be considered in reviewing this opinion.”
    or
    “The following material change(s) that occurred between the date of the statement for which this opinion is applicable and the date of this opinion should be considered in reviewing this opinion: [Describe the change or changes.]”
    Note: Choose one of the above two paragraphs, whichever is applicable.
    “This opinion is prepared for the use of company management and the New York Department of Financial Services for the purposes set forth in New York Insurance Law § 4217, and 11 NYCRR 95 (Insurance Regulation 126), as amended from time to time. This opinion covers business in force as of December 31, 20[ ] and does not cover new business issued subsequent to this date. This opinion does not cover all matters needed to assess the future capital and surplus adequacy of the company.
    The impact of unanticipated events subsequent to the date of this opinion is beyond the scope of this opinion. The analysis of asset adequacy portion of this opinion should be viewed recognizing that the company's future experience may not follow all the assumptions used in the analysis.

    Date Opinion is Signed.”

### (c) Assumptions for new issues.
The adoption for new issues or new claims or other new liabilities of an actuarial assumption which differs from a corresponding assumption used for prior new issues or new claims or other new liabilities is not a change in actuarial assumptions within the meaning of this section.

### (d) Adverse opinions.
If the appointed actuary is unable to form an opinion, he or she shall refuse to issue a statement of actuarial opinion. If the appointed actuary's opinion is adverse or qualified, he or she shall issue an adverse or qualified actuarial opinion explicitly stating the reasons for such opinion. Any statement for any adverse or qualified actuarial opinion shall follow the scope paragraph and precede the opinion paragraph.

## 95.9 Description of an actuarial memorandum.
### (a) General.
1) [Intentionally blank]
    * (i) Except as exempted in this Part, a memorandum, in form and substance acceptable to the superintendent as specified in this Part shall be prepared to support each actuarial opinion submitted pursuant to section 95.8 of this Part.
    * (ii) Except as provided in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, each company required to prepare the memorandum shall submit the memorandum to the superintendent as part of the actuarial opinion.
    * (iii) If a foreign or alien company has submitted to the insurance regulator of a state accredited by the NAIC a memorandum in support of an opinion of an appointed actuary for the prior year, which was in form and substance acceptable to such insurance regulator as evidenced in writing and was in support of an opinion of an appointed actuary that was required by laws or regulations of that state to meet standards adopted from time to time by the Actuarial Standards Board and such additional standards as such insurance regulator has prescribed, such foreign or alien company need submit the memorandum required by this section only at the request of the superintendent.
2) In preparing the memorandum, the appointed actuary may rely on, and include as a part of his or her own memorandum, memoranda prepared and signed by other actuaries who are qualified actuaries within the meaning of section 95.5(d) of this Part, with respect to the areas covered in such memoranda, and so state in their memoranda.
3) If the superintendent finds that the analysis described in any such memorandum fails to meet the standards of the Actuarial Standards Board or the standards and requirements of this Part, the superintendent may designate a qualified actuary (the “reviewing actuary”) to review the opinion and prepare such supporting memorandum as is required for review. The reasonable and necessary expenses of the independent review shall be paid by the company but the review shall be directed and controlled by the superintendent.
4) The reviewing actuary shall have the same status as an examiner for the purposes of obtaining data from the company, and the work papers and documentation of the reviewing actuary shall be retained by the superintendent; provided, however, that any information provided by the company to the reviewing actuary and included in the work papers shall be considered as material provided by the company to the superintendent and shall be kept confidential to the same extent as is prescribed by law and in this Part with respect to other material provided by the company to the superintendent pursuant to the statute governing this Part. The reviewing actuary shall not be a current or past employee of the company or an employee of a consulting firm involved with the preparation of any prior memorandum or opinion for the company pursuant to this Part for any one of the current year or the preceding three years.

Current through June 30, 2021


## 95.10 Additional considerations for analysis.
### (a) Aggregation.
For the asset adequacy analysis for the statement of actuarial opinion provided in accordance with section 95.8 of this Part, reserves and assets may be aggregated as follows:
1) Aggregation of the results of asset adequacy analysis of one or more products within a line of business as defined in section 95.4(i) of this Part, the reserves for which prove through analysis to be redundant, with the results of one or more products within a line of business, the reserves for which prove through analysis to be deficient. Where two or more products within a line of business are aggregated because they are backed by an investment segment, the rationale for each such segment shall be provided. The liability cash flows shall be projected separately for at least products with cash settlement options and products without cash settlement options.
2) With the prior written approval of the superintendent, based on the following guidelines, aggregation of the results of asset adequacy analysis for one or more lines of business, the reserves for which prove through analysis to be redundant, with the results of one or more lines of business, the reserves which prove to be deficient.
    * (i) In order to aggregate one or more lines of business, any cash-flow testing of assets and liabilities must be performed separately and the results reported for each line of business being aggregated.
    * (ii) If the asset adequacy analysis is done on an aggregate basis for lines of business with different testing periods, the common reference date shall be the valuation date.
    * (iii) If aggregation is used for one or more lines of business, the appointed actuary must provide, to the satisfaction of the superintendent, the following in the memorandum:
        * (a) a demonstration that the asset adequacy results for the various products or lines of business are developed using consistent economic scenarios or are subject to mutually independent risks, e.g., the likelihood of events impacting the adequacy of the assets supporting the redundant reserves is generally unrelated to the likelihood of events impacting the adequacy of the assets supporting the redundant reserves is generally unrelated to the likelihood of events impacting the adequacy of the assets supporting the deficient reserves;
        * (b) detailed descriptions of the assumptions used to develop the asset and liability cash flows; and
        * (c) where reserve redundancies of participating products or products with nonguaranteed elements are used to offset deficiencies, in addition to a description of dividends, experience rating or declaration of additional amounts, the memorandum shall include for the level scenario, a comparison of the modeled dividends and additional amounts to those actually paid over the recent past.
### (b) Selection of assets for analysis.
1) The determination or selection of assets should consider the investment allocation method used by the company (e.g., segmentation, dedicated or allocated assets and/or a proration of segmented, dedicated, or allocated assets in the general account). In allocating or assigning assets to the reserve liabilities (for asset adequacy analysis purposes) for which an opinion is rendered, the appointed actuary shall ascertain and report whether or not such selection is such that the adequacy of assets for other liabilities is prejudiced or endangered and shall include an appropriate statement as to such ascertainment. For example, if the assets remaining after such selection were long term assets with market value below book value or were bonds in danger of default, and the other liabilities were short term liabilities where cash is needed, the selection of the assets could have an adverse effect on the other liabilities.
2) The appointed actuary shall analyze those assets held in support of the reserves which are the subject of specific analysis, hereafter called “specified reserves.”
    * (i) Assets shall be assigned or allocated to each line of business so that any asset adequacy analysis may be performed for each line separately.
    * (ii) An asset may be allocated over several groups of specified reserves.
    * (iii) Where a portion of a particular asset supports a group of specified reserves, that portion cannot support any other group of specified reserves.
    * (iv) The annual statement value of the assets held on support of the specified reserves shall not exceed the annual statement value of the specified reserves, except as provided in subdivision (c) of this section.
    * (v) If the method of assets allocation is not consistent from year to year, the extent of its inconsistency should be described in the supporting memorandum.
### (c) Use of assets supporting the interest maintenance reserve and the asset valuation reserve.
1) An appropriate allocation of assets in the amount of the Interest Maintenance Reserve (IMR), whether positive or negative, must be used in any asset adequacy analysis.
2) Analysis of risks regarding asset default or write-down may include an appropriate allocation of assets supporting the Asset Valuation Reserve (AVR); these AVR assets may not be applied for any other risks with respect to reserve adequacy.
3) Analysis of these and other risks may include assets supporting other mandatory or voluntary reserves available to the extent not used for risk analysis and reserve support.
4) The amount of the assets used for the AVR and the IMR must be disclosed in the Table of Reserves and Liabilities of the opinion and in the memorandum.
5) The method used for selecting particular assets or allocated portions of assets must be disclosed in the memorandum.
### (d) Required interest scenarios.
1) For the purpose of performing the asset adequacy analysis required by this Part, the appointed actuary is expected to follow standards which are adopted by the Actuarial Standards Board and are not inconsistent with this Part; nevertheless, the appointed actuary must consider in the analysis the effect of at least the following interest rate scenarios:
    * (i) level with no deviation;
    * (ii) uniformly increasing over 10 years at a half percent (0.5%) per year and then level;
    * (iii) uniformly increasing at one percent per year over five years and then uniformly decreasing at one percent per year to the original level at the end of the 10 years and then level;
    * (iv) an immediate increase of three percent and then level;
    * (v) uniformly decreasing over 10 years at a half percent (0.5%) per year and then level;
    * (vi) uniformly decreasing at one percent per year over five years and then uniformly increasing at one percent per year to the original level at the end of 10 years and then level; and
    * (vii) an immediate decrease of three percent and then level.
2) For these and other scenarios which may be used, projected interest rates for a five year treasury note need not be reduced beyond the point where such five year treasury note yield would be at 50 percent of its initial level.
3) The beginning interest rates may be based on interest rates for new investments as of the valuation date similar to recent investments allocated to support the products being tested or be based on an outside index, such as treasury yields, of assets of the appropriate length on a date close to the valuation date. Whatever method is used to determine the beginning yield curve and associated interest rates should be specifically defined. The beginning yield curve and associated interest rates should be consistent for all interest rate scenarios.
4) In the event of a projected negative surplus (based on a comparison of market values of assets and liabilities at the end of the projection) for a prescribed scenario for any line of business, the actuary shall modify that scenario by decreasing the total interest rate change in 100 bases point intervals until there is a projected positive surplus. The projected results at each interval tested should be provided. In addition, the actuary shall use additional assets to determine the approximate additional amount so that there is no longer any negative surplus under the prescribed scenario without modification under paragraph (1) of this subdivision.
5) It is recognized that the adequacy of reserves and other actuarial items which are the subject of the opinion required by section 95.8 of this Part is a matter of judgment which the actuary rendering such opinion is to make in accordance with section 4217 of the Insurance Law and this Part. Consequently, failure under one or more of the scenarios prescribed by paragraph (1) of this subdivision would not necessarily prevent such actuary from expressing the opinion required by section 95.8 of this Part without qualification. However, the actuary shall furnish an analysis of the modified scenarios and of additional amounts under the prescribed scenarios without modification. If the actuary then opines that additional reserves are necessary, the actuary shall then explain and justify how the actuary determined the additional amount. The superintendent retains the right to request additional information with regard to these matters.
### (e) Withdrawal or lapse rates.
For interest sensitive products, such as single premium cash value deferred annuities of universal life insurance, the withdrawal rates might be sensitive to changes in new money rates and to market rates of competitors. The description of the withdrawal rates should include the formula along with sample rates or the tables of rates along with appropriate descriptions as to their applicability.
### (f) Calls.
1) In the absence of credible experience, the following are examples of acceptable procedures for coupon bonds without a call premium:
    * (i) assume no calls until the current interest rate is two percent less than the coupon rate, and then assume 100 percent call;
    * (ii) assume calls begin when the coupon rate exceeds the current interest rate and calls increase to 100 percent when the spread reaches three percent; and
    * (iii) assume a 100 percent call when the present value of the remaining bond cash flows, when discounted at a level interest rate at the then rate for the appropriate scenario, exceeds the call price plus an expense margin plus one percent.
2) The following are examples of acceptable procedures for coupon bonds with a call premium of up to five percent:
    * (i) assume no calls until the current interest rate is three percent less than the coupon rate and then assume 100 percent call;
    * (ii) assume calls begin when the coupon rate exceeds the current interest rate by one percent and calls increase to 100 percent when the spread reaches four percent; and
    * (iii) assume a 100 percent call when the present value of the remaining bond cash flows, when discounted at a level interest rate at the then rate for the appropriate scenario, exceeds the call price plus an expense margin plus one percent.
3) In case of Government National Mortgage Association obligations, other mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, some prepayment should be assumed such as, for example, five percent when the current interest rate equals or exceeds the coupon rate, with prepayments increasing to 50 percent when the coupon rate exceeds the current interest rate by four percent, or by linking the ratio of the market value to the loan balance to multiples of the Public Securities Association standard prepayment model.
4) Other procedures may be used for other types of obligations and other call premiums.
5) Any comparison of coupon rate and current interest rates and any comparison of present values with amount payable on call should be for like type and quality of assets and remaining duration to maturity.
### (g) Defaults.
In the absence of credible experience, it will be acceptable to make annual expense charges (or reductions in annual investment income) not less than 10 percent of the AVR maximum reserve for the bond, preferred stock, common stock or mortgage.
### (h) Testing period.
In general, the testing period for asset adequacy analysis should extend far enough into the future to cover the major portion of the future run out of insurance cash flows. This period may vary by product. For example:
1) For group guaranteed interest contracts with a lump sum payout and a maturity date of 10 or less years to run, full surrender should be assumed on the maturity date and the testing period should extend to the last maturity date.
2) In case of individual single premium cash value deferred annuities, full surrender of any persisting annuities should be assumed at the end of a 10 year testing period, unless specific approval is obtained for a longer period.
3) For lifetime annuities a testing period of at least 20 years, and perhaps longer, would be appropriate.
4) For life insurance, a testing period of at least 20 years, and perhaps longer, would be appropriate.
### (i) Market value of projected results.
The market value as of the end of the projection or testing period of any remaining assets and/or borrowed funds and of any remaining liabilities, and the net thereof, shall be provided based on assuming that the interest rate after such date would be frozen at the prevailing rate as of that date for the appropriate interest rate scenario. In the case of liabilities with cash values, where the assumption of 100 percent lapse is used, the value of the remaining liabilities would be the cash value. In the case of noncash value liabilities, the present value of future liability payments and expenses shall be discounted at the prevailing scenario interest rate. Where such market values are discounted back to the valuation date, the procedure for discounting shall be explained and justified based on the scenario. The date as of which market values are taken shall be clearly labeled.
### (j) Documentation.
The appointed actuary shall retain in file, for at least seven years, sufficient documentation so that it will be possible to determine the procedures followed, the analyses performed, the bases for assumptions and the results obtained.
