If the appointed actuary determines as the result of asset adequacy analysis that a reserve should be held in addition to the aggregate reserve held by the company and calculated in accordance with methods set forth in the Standard Valuation Law, the company shall establish the additional reserve.

Additional reserves established under Paragraph (2) above and deemed not necessary in subsequent years may be released. Any amounts released shall be disclosed in the actuarial opinion for the applicable year. The release of such reserves would not be deemed an adoption of a lower standard of valuation.

## Section 6. Statement of Actuarial Opinion Based On an Asset Adequacy Analysis

A. General Description. The statement of actuarial opinion submitted in accordance with this section shall consist of: A paragraph identifying the appointed actuary and his or her qualifications (see Subsection B(1));

A scope paragraph identifying the subjects on which an opinion is to be expressed and describing the scope of the appointed actuary's work, including a tabulation delineating the reserves and related actuarial items that have been analyzed for asset adequacy and the method of analysis, (see Subsection $\mathrm{B}(2)$ ) and identifying the reserves and related actuarial items covered by the opinion that have not been so analyzed;
(c) If the appointed actuary must disclose whether additional reserves as of the prior opinion date are released as of this opinion date, and the extent of the release;

(d) If the appointed actuary chooses to add a paragraph briefly describing the assumptions that form the basis for the actuarial opinion.

B. Recommended Language. The following paragraphs are to be included in the statement of actuarial opinion in accordance with this section. Language is that which in typical circumstances should be included in a statement of actuarial opinion. The language may be modified as needed to meet the circumstances of a particular case, but the appointed actuary should use language that clearly expresses his or her professional judgment. However, in any event the opinion shall retain all pertinent aspects of the language provided in this section.

The opening paragraph should generally indicate the appointed actuary's relationship to the company and his or her qualifications to sign the opinion. For a company actuary, the opening paragraph of the actuarial opinion should include a statement such as:

"I, [name], am [title] of [insurance company name] and a member of the American Academy of Actuaries. I was appointed by, or by the authority of, the Board of Directors of said insurer to render this opinion as stated in the letter to the commissioner dated [insert date]. I meet the Academy qualification standards for rendering the opinion and am familiar with the valuation requirements applicable to life and health insurance companies."

For a consulting actuary, the opening paragraph should include a statement such as:

"I, [name], a member of the American Academy of Actuaries, am associated with the firm of [name of consulting firm]. I have been appointed by, or by the authority of, the Board of Directors of [name of company] to render this opinion as stated in the letter to the commissioner dated [insert date]. I meet the Academy qualification standards for rendering the opinion and am familiar with the valuation requirements applicable to life and health insurance companies."

The scope paragraph should include a statement such as:

"I have examined the actuarial assumptions and actuarial methods used in determining reserves and related actuarial items listed below, as shown in the annual statement of the company, as prepared for filing with state regulatory officials, as of December 31, 20[ ]. Tabulated below are those reserves and related actuarial items which have been subjected to asset adequacy analysis.

Drafting Notes: (a) The additional actuarial reserves are the reserves established under Paragraph (2) of Section 5E; (b) The appointed actuary should indicate the method of analysis, determined in accordance with the standards for asset adequacy analysis referred to in Section 5D of this regulation, by means of symbols that should be defined in footnotes to the table; (c) Allocated amount of Asset Valuation Reserve (AVR).

(3) If the appointed actuary has relied on other experts to develop certain portions of the analysis, the reliance paragraph should include a statement such as:

"I have relied on [name], [title] for [e.g., "anticipated cash flows from currently owned assets, including variations in cash flows according to economic scenarios" or "certain critical aspects of the analysis performed in conjunction with forming my opinion"], as certified in the attached statement. I have reviewed the information relied upon for reasonableness.”

A statement of reliance on other experts should be accompanied by a statement by each of the experts in the form prescribed by Section 6E.

(4)

If the appointed actuary has examined the underlying asset and liability records, the reliance paragraph should include a statement such as:

"My examination included such review of the actuarial assumptions and actuarial methods and of the underlying basic asset and liability records and such tests of the actuarial calculations as I considered necessary. I also reconciled the underlying basic asset and liability records to [exhibits and schedules listed as applicable] of the company's current annual statement."

(5) If the appointed actuary has not examined the underlying records, but has relied upon data (e.g., listings and summaries of policies in force or asset records) prepared by the company, the reliance paragraph should include a statement such as:

"In forming my opinion on [specify types of reserves] I relied upon data prepared by [name and title of company officer certifying in force records or other data] as certified in the attached statements. I evaluated that data for reasonableness and consistency. I also reconciled that data to [exhibits and schedules to be listed as applicable] of the company's current annual statement. In other respects, my examination included review of the actuarial assumptions and actuarial methods used and tests of the calculations I considered necessary."

The section shall be accompanied by a statement by each person relied upon in the form prescribed by Subsection E.

The opinion paragraph should include a statement such as:

"In my opinion the reserves and related actuarial values concerning the statement items identified above:

(a) Are computed in accordance with presently accepted actuarial standards consistently applied and are fairly stated, in accordance with sound actuarial principles;

(b) Are based on actuarial assumptions that produce reserves at least as great as those called for in any contract provision as to reserve basis and method, and are in accordance with all other contract provisions;

(c) Meet the requirements of the Insurance Law and regulation of the state of [state of domicile]; and are at least as great as the minimum aggregate amounts required by the state in which this statement is filed;

(d) Are computed on the basis of assumptions consistent with those used in computing the corresponding items in the annual statement of the preceding year-end (with any exceptions noted below); and

(e) Include provision for all actuarial reserves and related statement items which ought to be established.

The reserves and related items, when considered in light of the assets held by the company with respect to such reserves and related actuarial items including, but not limited to, the investment earnings on the assets, and the considerations anticipated to be received and retained under the policies and contracts, make adequate provision, according to presently accepted actuarial standards of practice, for the anticipated cash flows required by the contractual obligations and related expenses of the company. (At the discretion of the commissioner, this language may be omitted for an opinion filed on behalf of a company doing business only in this state and in no other state.)

The actuarial methods, considerations and analyses used in forming my opinion conform to the appropriate Standards of Practice as promulgated by the Actuarial Standards Board, which standards form the basis of this statement of opinion.

This opinion is updated annually as required by statute. To the best of my knowledge, there have been no material changes from the applicable date of the annual statement to the date of the rendering of this opinion which should be considered in reviewing this opinion; or

The following material changes which occurred between the date of the statement for which this opinion is applicable and the date of this opinion should be considered in reviewing this opinion: (Describe the change or changes.)

Drafting Note: Choose one of the above two paragraphs, whichever is applicable.

The impact of unanticipated events subsequent to the date of this opinion is beyond the scope of this opinion. The analysis of asset adequacy portion of this opinion should be viewed recognizing that the company's future experience may not follow all the assumptions used in the analysis.

Signature of Appointed Actuary

Address of Appointed Actuary

Telephone Number of Appointed Actuary

Date"

C. Assumptions for New Issues

The adoption for new issues or new claims or other new liabilities of an actuarial assumption that differs from a corresponding assumption used for prior new issues or new claims or other new liabilities is not a change in actuarial assumptions within the meaning of this Section 6.

D. Adverse Opinions

If the appointed actuary is unable to form an opinion, then he or she shall refuse to issue a statement of actuarial opinion. If the appointed actuary's opinion is adverse or qualified, then he or she shall issue an adverse or qualified actuarial opinion explicitly stating the reasons for the opinion. This statement should follow the scope paragraph and precede the opinion paragraph.

E. Reliance on Information Furnished by Other Persons

If the appointed actuary relies on the certification of others on matters concerning the accuracy or completeness of any data underlying the actuarial opinion, or the appropriateness of any other information used by the appointed actuary in forming the actuarial opinion, the actuarial opinion should so indicate the persons the actuary is relying upon and a precise identification of the items subject to reliance. In addition, the persons on whom the appointed actuary relies shall provide a certification that precisely identifies the items on which the person is providing information and a statement as to the accuracy, completeness or reasonableness, as applicable, of the items. This certification shall include the signature, title, company, address and telephone number of the person rendering the certification, as well as the date on which it is signed.

## F. Alternate Option

(1) The Standard Valuation Law gives the commissioner broad authority to accept the valuation of a foreign insurer when that valuation meets the requirements applicable to a company domiciled in this state in the aggregate. As an alternative to the requirements of Subsection B(6)(c), the commissioner may make one or more of the following additional approaches available to the opining actuary:
(a) A statement that the reserves "meet the requirements of the insurance laws and regulations of the State of [state of domicile] and the formal written standards and conditions of this state for filing an opinion based on the law of the state of domicile." If the commissioner chooses to allow this alternative, a formal written list of standards and conditions shall be made available. If a company chooses to use this alternative, the standards and conditions in effect on July 1 of a calendar year shall apply to statements for that calendar year, and they shall remain in effect until they are revised or revoked. If no list is available, this alternative is not available.

(b) A statement that the reserves "meet the requirements of the insurance laws and regulations of the State of [state of domicile] and I have verified that the company's request to file an opinion based on the law of the state of domicile has been approved and that any conditions required by the commissioner for approval of that request have been met." If the commissioner chooses to allow this alternative, a formal written statement of such allowance shall be issued no later than March 31 of the year it is first effective. It shall remain valid until rescinded or modified by the commissioner. The rescission or modifications shall be issued no later than March 31 of the year they are first effective. Subsequent to that statement being issued, if a company chooses to use this alternative, the company shall file a request to do so, along with justification for its use, no later than April 30 of the year of the opinion to be filed. The request shall be deemed approved on October 1 of that year if the commissioner has not denied the request by that date.

(c) A statement that the reserves "meet the requirements of the insurance laws and regulations of the State of [state of domicile] and I have submitted the required comparison as specified by this state.”

(i) If the commissioner chooses to allow this alternative, a formal written list of products (to be added to the table in Item (ii) below) for which the required comparison shall be provided will be published. If a company chooses to use this alternative, the list in effect on July 1 of a calendar year shall apply to statements for that calendar year, and it shall remain in effect until it is revised or revoked. If no list is available, this alternative is not available.

(ii) If a company desires to use this alternative, the appointed actuary shall provide a comparison of the gross nationwide reserves held to the gross nationwide reserves that would be held under NAIC codification standards. Gross nationwide reserves are the total reserves calculated for the total company in force business directly sold and assumed, indifferent to the state in which the risk resides, without reduction for reinsurance ceded. The information provided shall be at least:

| $(1)$ <br> Product Type | $(2)$ <br> Death Benefit or <br> Account Value | $(3)$ <br> Reserves Held | (4) <br> Codification <br> Reserves | (5) <br> Standardion <br> Standard |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |

(iii) The information listed shall include all products identified by either the state of filing or any other states subscribing to this alternative.

(iv) If there is no codification standard for the type of product or risk in force or if the codification standard does not directly address the type of product or risk in force, the appointed actuary shall provide detailed disclosure of the specific method and assumptions used in determining the reserves held.
(v) The comparison provided by the company is to be kept confidential to the same extent and under the same conditions as the actuarial memorandum.

Notwithstanding the above, the commissioner may reject an opinion based on the laws and regulations of the state of domicile and require an opinion based on the laws of this state. If a company is unable to provide the opinion within sixty (60) days of the request or such other period of time determined by the commissioner after consultation with the company, the commissioner may contract an independent actuary at the company's expense to prepare and file the opinion.

## Section 7. Description of Actuarial Memorandum Including an Asset Adequacy Analysis and Regulatory Asset Adequacy Issues Summary

A.
In accordance with [insert state equivalent of Section 3 of the Standard Valuation Law], the appointed actuary shall prepare a memorandum to the company describing the analysis done in support of his or her opinion regarding the reserves. The memorandum shall be made available for examination by the commissioner upon his or her request but shall be returned to the company after such examination and shall not be considered a record of the insurance department or subject to automatic filing with the commissioner.

In preparing the memorandum, the appointed actuary may rely on, and include as a part of his or her own memorandum, memoranda prepared and signed by other actuaries who are qualified within the meaning of Section 5B of this regulation, with respect to the areas covered in such memoranda, and so state in their memoranda.

If the commissioner requests a memorandum and no such memorandum exists or if the commissioner finds that the analysis described in the memorandum fails to meet the standards of the Actuarial Standards Board or the standards and requirements of this regulation, the commissioner may designate a qualified actuary to review the opinion and prepare such supporting memorandum as is required for review. The reasonable and necessary expense of the independent review shall be paid by the company but shall be directed and controlled by the commissioner.

The reviewing actuary shall have the same status as an examiner for purposes of obtaining data from the company and the work papers and documentation of the reviewing actuary shall be retained by the commissioner; provided, however, that any information provided by the company to the reviewing actuary and included in the work papers shall be considered as material provided by the company to the commissioner and shall be kept confidential to the same extent as is prescribed by law with respect to other material provided by the company to the commissioner pursuant to the statute governing this regulation. The reviewing actuary shall not be an employee of a consulting firm involved with the preparation of any prior memorandum or opinion for the insurer pursuant to this regulation for any one of the current year or the preceding three (3) years.

In accordance with [insert reference to state equivalent to Section 3 of the Standard Valuation Law], the appointed actuary shall prepare a regulatory asset adequacy issues summary, the contents of which are specified in Subsection C. The regulatory asset adequacy issues summary will be submitted no later than March 15 of the year following the year for which a statement of actuarial opinion based on asset adequacy is required. The regulatory asset adequacy issues summary is to be kept confidential to the same extent and under the same conditions as the actuarial memorandum.

B. Details of the Memorandum Section Documenting Asset Adequacy Analysis

When an actuarial opinion is provided, the memorandum shall demonstrate that the analysis has been done in accordance with the standards for asset adequacy referred to in Section 5D of this regulation and any additional standards under this regulation. It shall specify:
(a) Product descriptions including market description, underwriting and other aspects of a risk profile and the specific risks the appointed actuary deems significant;

(b) Source of liability in force;

(c) Reserve method and basis;

(d) Investment reserves;

(e) Reinsurance arrangements;

(f) Identification of any explicit or implied guarantees made by the general account in support of benefits provided through a separate account or under a separate account policy or contract and the methods used by the appointed actuary to provide for the guarantees in the asset adequacy analysis;

(g) Documentation of assumptions to test reserves for the following:

(i) Lapse rates (both base and excess);

(ii) Interest crediting rate strategy;

(iii) Mortality;

(iv) Policyholder dividend strategy;

(v) Competitor or market interest rate;

(vi) Annuitization rates;

(vii) Commissions and expenses; and

(viii) Morbidity.

The documentation of the assumptions shall be such that an actuary reviewing the actuarial memorandum could form a conclusion as to the reasonableness of the assumptions.

For assets:

(a) Portfolio descriptions, including a risk profile disclosing the quality, distribution and types of assets;

(b) Investment and disinvestment assumptions;

(c) Source of asset data;

(d) Asset valuation bases; and

(e) Documentation of assumptions made for:

(i) Default costs;

(ii) Bond call function;

(iii) Mortgage prepayment function;
(v) Determining yield on assets acquired through the investment strategy.

The documentation of the assumptions shall be such that an actuary reviewing the actuarial memorandum could form a conclusion as to the reasonableness of the assumptions.

For the analysis basis:

(a) Methodology;

(b) Rationale for inclusion or exclusion of different blocks of business and how pertinent risks were analyzed;

(c) Rationale for degree of rigor in analyzing different blocks of business (include in the rationale the level of "materiality" that was used in determining how rigorously to analyze different blocks of business);

(d) Criteria for determining asset adequacy (include in the criteria the precise basis for determining if assets are adequate to cover reserves under "moderately adverse conditions" or other conditions as specified in relevant actuarial standards of practice); and

(e) Whether the impact of federal income taxes was considered and the method of treating reinsurance in the asset adequacy analysis;

(4) Summary of material changes in methods, procedures, or assumptions from prior year's asset adequacy analysis;

(5) Summary of results; and

(6) Conclusions

C. Details of the Regulatory Asset Adequacy Issues Summary

(1) The regulatory asset adequacy issues summary shall include:

(a) Descriptions of the scenarios tested (including whether those scenarios are stochastic or deterministic) and the sensitivity testing done relative to those scenarios. If negative ending surplus results under certain tests in the aggregate, the actuary should describe those tests and the amount of additional reserve as of the valuation date which, if held, would eliminate the negative aggregate surplus values. Ending surplus values shall be determined by either extending the projection period until the in force and associated assets and liabilities at the end of the projection period are immaterial or by adjusting the surplus amount at the end of the projection period by an amount that appropriately estimates the value that can reasonably be expected to arise from the assets and liabilities remaining in force.

(b) The extent to which the appointed actuary uses assumptions in the asset adequacy analysis that are materially different than the assumptions used in the previous asset adequacy analysis;

(c) The amount of reserves and the identity of the product lines that had been subjected to asset adequacy analysis in the prior opinion but were not subject to analysis for the current opinion;
(d) Comments on any interim results that may be of significant concern to the appointed actuary. For example, the impact of the insufficiency of assets to support the payment of benefits and expenses and the establishment of statutory reserves during one or more interim periods;

(e) The methods used by the actuary to recognize the impact of reinsurance on the company's cash flows, including both assets and liabilities, under each of the scenarios tested; and

(f) Whether the actuary has been satisfied that all options whether explicit or embedded, in any asset or liability (including but not limited to those affecting cash flows embedded in fixed income securities) and equity-like features in any investments have been appropriately considered in the asset adequacy analysis.

The regulatory asset adequacy issues summary shall contain the name of the company for which the regulatory asset adequacy issues summary is being supplied and shall be signed and dated by the appointed actuary rendering the actuarial opinion.

D. Conformity to Standards of Practice. The memorandum shall include a statement:

"Actuarial methods, considerations and analysis used in the preparation of this memorandum conform to the appropriate Standards of Practice as promulgated by the Actuarial Standards Board, which standards form the basis for this memorandum.”

E. Use of Assets Supporting the Interest Maintenance Reserve and the Asset Valuation Reserve

An appropriate allocation of assets in the amount of the interest maintenance reserve (IMR), whether positive or negative, shall be used in any asset adequacy analysis. Analysis of risks regarding asset default may include an appropriate allocation of assets supporting the asset valuation reserve (AVR); these AVR assets may not be applied for any other risks with respect to reserve adequacy. Analysis of these and other risks may include assets supporting other mandatory or voluntary reserves available to the extent not used for risk analysis and reserve support.

The amount of the assets used for the AVR shall be disclosed in the table of reserves and liabilities of the opinion and in the memorandum. The method used for selecting particular assets or allocated portions of assets shall be disclosed in the memorandum.

Drafting Note: It has been suggested by some that, if the required interest rate scenarious are removed, they should be restored in five years if the commissioner is not satisfied with the scenarios upon which the asset adequacy opinion is based.

F. Documentation. The appointed actuary shall retain on file, for at least seven (7) years, sufficient documentation so that it will be possible to determine the procedures followed, the analyses performed, the bases for assumptions and the results obtained.

## ACTUARIAL OPINION AND MEMORANDUM REGULATION

## KEY:

MODEL ADOPTION: States that have citations identified in this column adopted the most recent version of the NAIC model in a substantially similar manner. This requires states to adopt the model in its entirety but does allow for variations in style and format. States that have adopted portions of the current NAIC model will be included in this column with an explanatory note.

RELATED STATE ACTIVITY: Examples of Related State Activity include but are not limited to: older versions of the NAIC model, statutes or regulations addressing the same subject matter, or other administrative guidance such as bulletins and notices. States that have citations identified in this column only (and nothing listed in the Model Adoption column) have not adopted the most recent version of the NAIC model in a substantially similar manner.

NO CURRENT ACTIVITY: No state activity on the topic as of the date of the most recent update. This includes states that have repealed legislation as well as states that have never adopted legislation.
