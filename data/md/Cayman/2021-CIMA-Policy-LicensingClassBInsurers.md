## 1. Statement of Objectives

1.1 This Regulatory Policy sets out criteria for the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority ("the Authority") to grant licenses to class B insurers pursuant to section 4 of the Insurance Act ("IA" or "the Act").

## 2. Scope of Application

2.1 The Insurance Act (as amended) requires persons to obtain a class B insurer licence "for the carrying on of insurance business other than domestic business". For the purpose of this Regulatory Policy ("Policy"), the term "insurance business" includes reinsurance business and the "insurer" includes "reinsurer", unless specifically stated.

2.2 This Policy is applicable to persons seeking to carry on insurance business as a class B insurer ("applicants") in or from within the Cayman Islands.

2.3 This Policy should be read in conjunction with the Act, its Regulations, rules and other regulatory measures issued by the Authority, which provide guidance on various topics applicable to class $B$ insurers, including but not limited to fitness and propriety, internal controls, risk management, corporate governance, outsourcing and audit waivers.

## 3. Introduction

3.1 Pursuant to section 4(1) of the Act, "A person desiring to carry on -

(a) Insurance business;

(b) Reinsurance business; or

(c) business as an insurance agent, insurance broker or insurance manager, in or from within the Islands shall make an application in writing to the Authority for the grant of a licence(...), and the Authority if satisfied (...), may approve the application and business plan and grant a licence (...)."

3.2 Section 4(3) of the Law sets out the various subcategories of licences for Class $B$ insurers that the Authority can grant. Applicants must note that each subcategory of class B licenses are distinct licence types.

3.3 Section 4(3) establishes the following:

"Subject to subsection (4), the categories of licences which may be granted by the Authority are -

(b) class $B$ insurer licence, for the carrying on of insurance business other than domestic business in respect of which -

(i) at least ninety-five per cent of the net premiums written will originate from the insurer's related business;

(ii) over fifty per cent of the net written premiums will originate from the insurer's related business; or

(iii) fifty per cent or less of the net written premiums will originate from the insurer's related business.

3.4 Forms for making an application for a licence and information to accompany such application are set out in the Insurance (Applications and Fees) Regulations ("Regulations").

## 4. Definitions

4.1 For the purpose of this Policy, the following definitions have been provided for clarity.

### 4.1.1 Related business

Under Section 2 of the Law, "related business" in the context of section 4(3)(b) means business which will originate from the insurer's members or the members of any group with which it is related through common ownership or a common risk management plan, or as determined by the Authority.

The Authority seeks to provide further clarity to the legal definition by providing the following explanations for the term "related business":

(a) "related business" means business which will originate from the insurer's members or the members of any group with which it is related through common ownership - this applies to selfinsurance programmes whereby the Class $B$ insurer's purpose is to provide insurance coverage to its shareholders and/or affiliated entities, which share the same ultimate ownership as the Class B insurer. Such arrangements include group captives where the business will originate from the insurer's members/shareholders who may not be related through common ownership.

The insurance coverage provided by the Class B insurer may take different contract forms such as direct writing, coinsurance, fronting arrangement, reinsurance, etc. Notwithstanding the form of policy contract arrangement, the key consideration to qualify as related business is that the original (primary) source of risk must be from a member affiliated with the Class B insurer through direct or ultimate ownership, that is, the original party who would bear financial loss if the original risk insured occurred.

It should therefore be noted that if the original source of risk is from third parties, generated in the course of commercial business, the (re)insurance programme covered by the Class $B$ insurer would not qualify as "related business".

(b) "related business" means business which will originate from the members of any group with which the insurer is related through a common risk management plan - this applies to self-insurance programmes whereby the Class B insurer's purpose is to provide insurance coverage to a defined or closed group of insured entities operating in similar or diverse industries who are not related to each other and who may or may not have ownership interest in the Class $B$ insurer but all of whom subscribe to a
common risk management framework. The following are some of the key characteristics that the Authority expect to be inherent in a common risk management framework to qualify as related business: defined type of risks to be covered, defined member entry and exit criteria, standard criteria for assessing and pricing risks, defined criteria for sharing risks among group members, common risk control mechanisms/strategies, common claims reporting and management function, and common risk management oversight function which actively evaluates and reports on implementation of the common risk management framework by members of the group.

(c) "related business" means business as determined by the Authority on a case by case basis. Where the principles outlined under (a) and (b) are not clearly evident, the Authority has sole discretion in determining "related business" based on the circumstances and documentation presented by applicants for the Class B Insurer licence.

## 5. General Considerations

5.1 The Authority, where satisfied with the application, may process and issue a licence within the timeframe specified in Appendix E2 of the Regulatory Handbook. The specified timeframe commences when the Authority is in receipt of a complete application form with all the required information and supporting documentation.

## 6. Procedure for Licensing Class B Insurers

6.1 The Authority will apply provisions of the Act, its Regulations and this Policy to assess applicants when considering issuing class B licenses.

6.2 Persons seeking to carry on insurance business as a class $B$ insurer shall submit a completed application form with all the information required pursuant to the Act and Regulations.

6.3 Applicants shall pay licence application fees as prescribed under the Regulations when making an application.

6.4 Applications for licensing for Class B insurers will be presented to the Authority's Management Committee, which meets weekly, for approval.

6.5 The Authority, where satisfied with the application, may process and approve the application within the timeframe specified in the Regulatory Handbook (refer to section 5 of this Policy). Once the approval requirements/conditions are met by the applicant, the licence certificate will be issued within 2-3 business days.

6.6 Where the approval of the application is subject to requirements/conditions, the applicant must meet the requirements/conditions within 6 months of the date of the approval. Upon request, the Authority may consider granting
additional time to meet the prescribed requirements/conditions. Failure to meet the requirements/conditions within 6 months or before the extended deadline will result in the approval of the application becoming null and void.

6.7 The Authority may reject an application where the applicant does not meet the requirements prescribed in the Law, Regulations, the criteria set out in this Policy or where the Authority believes that granting a licence would not be in the best interests of the public, proposed shareholders, policyholders, or creditors.

6.8 Any changes to the information provided in the application prior to granting the licence must be disclosed immediately. Such changes will have to be approved by the Management Committee.

6.9 The Authority may at its discretion contact an overseas regulatory authority, which supervises the applicant or any affiliate of the applicant or any entity involved in the (re)insurance program, as part of its due diligence assessment of the licence application.

## 7. Assessment Criteria for Licensing Class B Insurers

7.1 The Authority assesses applications with respect to fitness and propriety, funding and collateral arrangements, business plan, track record, transparency, risk management, internal controls, and systems for combating money laundering, terrorist financing, proliferation financing and sanctions monitoring.

7.2 Applicants shall demonstrate that they meet the definition of the appropriate class B insurer licence category pursuant to the Law. For this purpose, applicants shall provide details of the intended transaction and features of the proposed entity.

7.3 The Authority will consider each application on its own merits and will consider all relevant factors, including the criteria below.

7.4 Applicants that are segregated portfolio companies ("SPCs") shall satisfy the below criteria separately for each proposed segregated portfolio.

### 7.5 Fit and Proper Criteria and Management

7.5.1 According to the Law, the Authority shall not grant a licence unless it is satisfied that the business of the applicant will be carried on by persons who are fit and proper persons to be directors, managers or officers. The Authority must be satisfied that persons holding control of a licensee are fit and proper.

7.5.2 The Authority will apply the criteria and procedure set out in the Regulatory Policy and Regulatory Procedure on Fitness and Propriety in determining whether persons holding control, directors and persons responsible for controlled functions of the applicant are fit and proper.

7.5.3 In determining whether a person is fit and proper, the Authority considers that person's:
(a) Honesty, integrity and reputation;

(b) Competence and capability; and

(c) Financial soundness.

7.6 Fit and proper assessments will be conducted on persons responsible for controlled functions where applicants will have staff to discharge controlled functions in the jurisdiction.

7.7 Where an applicant chooses to outsource its management function to an Insurance Manager ("IM"), the Authority requires that the IM is adequately qualified, resourced, and fit and proper to carry on that outsourced function.

7.8 Additionally, where an IM has been appointed, the IM should be licensed and in good standing with the Authority.

7.9 Where a trust is a shareholder of the applicant, the Authority shall conduct fit and proper assessments, including complete due diligence for anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing ("AML/CFT") purposes (particularly where it is not licensed in the Cayman Islands) on the said trust, trustees and the ultimate beneficiary(ies).

8.5 Upon approval, the Authority will simultaneously cancel the current licence and reissue the replacement licence. The Authority will not charge a licence surrender or cancellation fee when an entity applies for a reclassification of a licence.

## 9. Additional Guidance for Segregated Portfolio Companies

9.1 Where an applicant for a class ' $B$ ' licence is formed as an SPC, the following may be used to assist in determining the correct class ' $B$ ' insurer subcategory.

9.1.1 When an SPC has multiple Segregated Portfolios ("SPs") and no Portfolio Insurance Companies ("PICs"), the Authority will review proposed insurance programme for each SP to determine whether the SP is carrying on related business. Where the SPC has issued shares or has
issued shares on behalf of an SP to a party or parties whose risks are (re)insured by the SP, then that SP is considered carrying on insurance business originating from the SP's related business. The percentage of the net premiums written by all SPs carrying on insurance business originating from related parties will then be used to determine the correct class ' $B$ ' insurer category. When the core also carries on insurance business, net premiums written by the core originating from related parties will also be used to determine the correct class ' $B$ ' insurer category.

9.1.2 When an SPC only has PICs, and the core does not carry on insurance business, the class ' $B$ ' insurer classification may be determined based on the percentage of the net premiums written by all PICs originating from related parties.

9.1.3 When an SPC has both SPs and PICs, the class ' $B$ ' insurer classification may be determined based on the percentage of the net premiums written by all SPs, PICs and the core carrying on insurance business originating from related parties.

## 10. Record Retention

10.1 Applicants shall provide details on how and where their books and records, including management information will be stored securely and could be accessed at all reasonable times.

Applicants shall refer to the Authority's Statement of Guidance on the Nature, Accessibility and Retention of Records and any additional guidance issued.

## 11. Redomiciled Entities

11.1 Where applicable, applicants who are redomiciling entities must provide up to five (5) years of audited statements to the Authority for evaluation with their application.

## 12. Additional Requirements

12.1 In addition to the above, the Authority may require any other information or documentation that is necessary for processing an application and granting a licence.
