## Rules and Statement of Guidance on Reinsurance Arrangements

## 1. Introduction

1.1. This document establishes the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority's (the "Authority" or "CIMA") Rules and Statement of Guidance on Reinsurance Arrangements. These Rules and Statement of Guidance should be read in conjunction with all laws and regulatory measures addressing insurance business and any other relevant laws and regulatory instruments issued by the Authority from time to time.

2.2. The Authority recognises that reinsurance arrangements will vary according to the manner in which the business of the insurer is structured, organised and managed; its business objectives; its size; and the nature, scale and complexity of its operations. The overriding principle, however, is that reinsurance arrangements must be adequate to satisfy the requirements of the Authority and relevant acts and regulations.

## 3. Statutory Authority

3.1. The measure is consistent with the Authority's statutory objectives as prescribed in the Monetary Authority Act, including Section 34 of the Monetary Authority Act which provides that the Authority may issue rules, statements of principles or guidance:

## 4. Scope of Application

4.1. These Rules and Statement of Guidance apply to all insurers and registered PICs supervised by the Authority in accordance with the Insurance Act, (as amended) that use outward reinsurance. These Rules and Statement of

4.2. The Authority will consider the contents of these Rules and Statement of Guidance in its supervisory processes including onsite inspection.
