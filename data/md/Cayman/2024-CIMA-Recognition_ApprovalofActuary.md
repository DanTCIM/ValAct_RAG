## 1. Statement of Objectives

1.1. The Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (the "Authority" or "CIMA") seeks to ensure that regulated insurers have an effective actuarial function capable of evaluating and providing advice regarding, at least, technical provisions, premium and pricing activities, capital adequacy, reinsurance, and compliance with related statutory and regulatory requirements. A robust actuarial function that is well positioned, resourced, properly recognised, approved and staffed is essential for the proper operation of the insurer. It plays a key role as part of the insurer's overall systems of risk management and internal controls.

1.2. This Regulatory Policy (the "Policy") sets out the minimum criteria and the process that the Authority will use for determining whether to recognise and approve an actuary pursuant to applicable sections of the Insurance Act (as amended) and in accordance with the professional standards of all internationally recognised actuarial governing bodies.

1.3. The Policy applies a principle of objectivity on all approved actuaries ensuring that their professional or business judgments are not compromised by bias, conflict of interest, or the undue influence of others. Hence, this Policy seeks to establish that actuaries approved by the Authority have a legal obligation to comply with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions where they operate. They must act with integrity, maintain professional competence, and uphold the interests of policyholders and insurers. These obligations include:

1. (a) Adhering to the Code of Professional Conduct as set by recognised actuarial bodies.
1. (b) Ensuring transparency and accountability in all actuarial decisions and communications.
1. (c) Reporting any breaches of legal or professional standards promptly.
1. (d) Maintaining independence in judgment and avoiding conflicts of interest.

By meeting these obligations, actuaries play a critical role in protecting policyholder interests and maintaining public trust in the actuarial profession.

1.4. The Authority will adopt a balanced and fair approach in assessing whether to disqualify an approved actuary if it finds itself in breach of its legal and professional obligations, or ethical conduct consistent with the criteria for recognition and approval (outlined in section 11 of this Policy).

## 2. Statutory Authority

2.1. Pursuant to section 34(8) of the Monetary Authority Act ("MAA"), "The Authority may at all reasonable times, by notice in writing given-

1. (e) to a person regulated under the regulatory laws;
2. (f) to a connected person; or
3. (g) to a person reasonably believed to have information relevant to an enquiry by the Authority,require that person -
	1. (i) to provide specified information or information of a specified description; or
	2. (ii) to produce specified documents or documents of a specified description, as it may reasonably require in connection with the exercise by the Authority of its regulatory functions."

2.2. Section 6(2) (a) and (b) of the MAA provides that "In performing its functions and managing its affairs, the Authority shall:
	1. (a) act in the best economic interests of the Islands; and
	2. (b) promote and maintain a sound financial system in the Islands".

2.3. Section 6(3)(a) of the MAA provides that "In performing its regulatory functions and its co-operative functions, the Authority shall, in addition to complying with the requirements of subsection (2) -
    (a) endeavour to promote and enhance market confidence, consumer protection and the reputation of the Islands as a financial centre;"

2.4. Section 2(2) of the Insurance Act provides for a fit and proper assessment of an actuary whether the individual is in-house or external.
"For the purposes of this Law -

1. (a) in determining whether a person is a fit and proper person, the Authority shall have regard to all circumstances, including that person's -
	1. (i) honesty, integrity and reputation;
	2. (ii) competence and capability; and
	3. (iii) financial soundness; (...)"

2.5. This document establishes the Regulatory Policy on the criteria for the Recognition and Approval of an Actuary. It should be read in conjunction with the regulatory measures issued by the Authority from time to time, particularly the Insurance (Reporting) Regulations, the Rules and Statement of Guidance for Actuarial Valuations, and the Insurance Act (as amended).

## 3. Scope of Application

3.1. The Insurance Act (the "Act") refers to actuaries in sections 2 and 9.

3.2. Section 9(1)(b) of the Act establishes a requirement for insurers writing longterm business to submit to the Authority an actuarially determined assets and liabilities valuation certified by actuaries approved by the Authority whilst section 9 (3) provides exemption for some class of insurers from the requirement.

1. a) Section 9(1) provides that "An insurer shall, except as otherwise approved by the Authority in writing and subject to subsection (3), submit to the Authority by way of annual return, within six months of the end of its financial year - 
	1. (b) an actuarial valuation of its assets and liabilities including loss and loss expense provisions, certified by an actuary approved by the Authority"
	2. b) Section 9(3) stipulates that "The following exemptions apply to the requirements of subsection (1) -
		1. (a) a class $C$ insurer or a class $B$ insurer that does not write long-term business is not required to make submissions under subsection (1)(b) or (c); and
		2. (b) the Authority may in writing exempt other classes of insurer from the requirement under subsection (1)(b) whether it considers it appropriate, based on the nature, scale or scope of the insurance business involved".

3.3. As defined in sections 9(1)(b) and 9(3) of the Insurance Act, this Policy applies to all insurers regulated by the Authority except for a class C and a class B insurer that does not write long-term business.

3.4. The Authority may in writing exempt other classes of insurers from the requirement where it considers it appropriate, based on the nature, scale, or scope of the insurance business involved.

3.5. The Authority may in writing require licensees who write short-term business to appoint an actuary where it considers it appropriate, based on the nature, scale, or scope of the insurance business involved.

3.6. The criteria applicable for the recognition of an actuary are provided in sections 5 and 6 of this Policy and are concomitant with section 2(1) of the Insurance Act and the approval of an actuary, including the peer reviewing actuary consistent with section 9 (1)(b) of the Insurance Act.

### 5.2. Criteria for Recognising Actuaries from other Actuarial Bodies

### 5.2.1. Education requirements

a) The Authority may recognise an actuary who is a fellowship member in good standing with some other actuarial body that implements and maintains education requirements that match or exceed the educational requirements of the professional associations listed in section 2 of the Insurance Act.

### 5.2.2. Code of Professional Conduct

1. (ii) shall not act against the public interest;

## 6. Criteria for Approval

6.1. The Authority will approve an actuary who meets the minimum criteria pursuant to section 9 (1)(b) of the Insurance Act.

6.1.1 The Authority will assess the acceptability of an actuary for approval by applying the following criteria:

1. a) Sufficiency of post-fellowship experience in the relevant line of business such as Life, Annuity, or Reinsurance business is considered by the Authority to be five (5) years.
1. b) In lieu of an actuary having five (5) years post-fellowship experience, the Authority will comprehensively consider the applicable work experience, standing, education, and other factors of an actuarial candidate.
1. c) The Authority expects the actuary to meet the continuing professional development requirements promulgated by their official actuarial body.
1. d) The Authority will also assess whether the actuary is clear of any disciplinary issues outstanding with their professional body.
1. e) In determining the objectivity of an actuary, the Authority expects that the actuary is not in a position of any actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest, and the Authority will assess whether there has been full disclosure of any actual or potential, or perceived conflict to the Authority, and consider the actuary's ability to act fairly and is unimpaired.

6.2. If an actuarial firm provides an actuary to a licensee, the Authority expects that the actuary is acting in his/her professional capacity on behalf of the firm. The actuarial firm is responsible for ensuring that the actuarial services provided meet professional standards and regulatory requirements, in accordance with section 9(1) of the Insurance Act. If the actuary is employed by the licensee and so not by an external firm, they are still expected by the Authority to be acting in his/her professional capacity within the context of their professional body's guidelines

6.3. In addition, consistent with section 2(2) of the Insurance Act, the Authority shall determine whether an actuary is fit and proper for an actuarial function, considering the integrity, honesty, reputation, competence, capability, and financial soundness of the proposed actuary.

## 7. Approval Process

7.1. The Authority will review the documentation provided by the licensee to establish that its candidate for an actuarial position meets the approval criteria in section 6 of this Policy. This documentation assessed includes, but is not limited to:

1. a) A cover letter from the licensee making a request for the named candidate to be approved. This letter should:
	1. (i) include a written explanation for any change from the current actuary, if applicable, except when the change involves a different individual within the same actuarial firm. In such cases, the licensee must notify the Authority of the change and confirm that the new individual meets the required qualifications and standards.
	2. (ii) confirm that the appointed actuary shall have the ability to communicate directly with the board of the licensee without the need for management review or approval and that the board shall have direct access to the actuary.
2. c) A resume from the candidate with information about relevant qualifications, including membership in professional associations, employment history, and related work experience.
3. d) Certified copies ${ }^{3}$ of certificates and/or confirming evidence from credentialing actuarial bodies attesting to the fact that the candidate is a qualified fellowship member in good standing of the relevant association.

## 8. Notification of Approval

8.1. The Authority shall, upon its approval of the candidate for the subject licensee, issue a written notification to the licensee of such approval. Such notification may include specified conditions and may restrict the approval to specific components of the insurance business.

8.2. If the Authority refuses to approve a candidate as an actuary for a licensee, a written notification will be issued to the licensee of such refusal. Such notification may include specified reasons based on which the Authority refused to approve the candidate as an actuary for the licensee.

## 9. Change in Actuary

9.1. Where a licensee is changing an approved Actuary, the Authority will consider written notice of the proposed change, inclusive of any supporting documentation such as the outgoing actuary's resignation or termination letter, in the approval of the new actuary.

## 10. Change of Business Plan

10.1. The Authority expects a licensee will provide any change of business plan and the reasons for such change to allow the Authority to properly assess and approve an actuary based on the nature, scale, and scope of the insurance business involved. This is in alignment with a licensee's obligations under Section 8(1)(a) of the Insurance Act which states that a licensee shall carry on insurance business only in accordance with the information given in its approved licence application and business plan and shall seek the prior written approval of the Authority for any change to the approved business plan or in the information supplied in the application.

[^2]10.2. In addition, the Authority also notes that in line with the Monetary Authority (Administrative Fines) Regulation, a licensee commits a very serious offence if it fails to seek prior written approval of the Authority for any change to the approved business plan.

## 11. Disqualifications

11.1. The Authority may require that a licensee removes a person occupying the role of actuary where the Authority considers the person to be no longer fit and proper for the role. Criteria for disqualification include but are not limited to, where the person:

1. a) Has failed to perform the functions and duties of such appointment satisfactorily in the view of the Authority; or
2. b) No longer meets the recognition and approval criteria for such an appointment; or
3. c) Fails to meet the continuing professional development requirements promulgated by the actuary's professional actuarial body; or
4. d) Is subject to an actual, potential, or perceived conflict of interest that impedes the actuary's ability to act fairly but there has not been a full disclosure of the conflict of interest to the Authority.

11.2. If an actuarial firm is appointed, the firm is responsible for ensuring that any individual assigned to sign the actuarial report maintains their professional qualifications and complies with continuing professional development requirements. The Authority notes that it is the insurer's obligation to ensure that the actuarial firm has robust processes in place to meet these requirements.

11.3. If the Authority becomes aware that an actuary or actuarial firm no longer meets the criteria of this Policy, its actuarial reports may not be accepted by the Authority, and it may prejudice the approval by the Authority of the actuary or actuarial firm to act on behalf of licensees in the future.

11.4. In the event that an actuary falls outside of the criteria for approval, the Authority shall follow due process for disqualification in compliance with the applicable regulatory laws, and the Authority's policies and procedures policies for the exercise of the enforcement actions; and shall not revoke its approval unless it has first notified the actuary and the licensee of its intention to do so.
