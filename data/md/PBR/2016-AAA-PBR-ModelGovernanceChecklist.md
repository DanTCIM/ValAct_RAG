The Principle-Based Reserves Checklist Subgroup of the Model Governance Work Group of the American Academy of Actuaries has developed a model governance checklist. This nonexhaustive checklist is offered as a resource for practicing life actuaries involved in actuarial model governance. Its development was prompted in response to the need for good model governance as addressed in PBR regulation; however, it will also be of value wherever actuarial modeling is performed. It should also be made clear that although this checklist represents model governance practices that many life actuaries and their companies would aspire to, they will not apply in every situation, as model governance is a complex and evolving process specific to a company's modeling environment.

A model is defined in the most recent exposure draft of the Modeling Actuarial Standard as "A representation of relationships among variables, entities, or events using statistical, financial, economic, mathematical, or scientific concepts and equations." It is likely that all the models that life actuaries work with will fall into these categories, but for the purposes of this checklist, there is no intention to exclude any model that life actuaries would work with.

While checklist items are presented in question format, they are only intended to foster awareness of the respective model governance concerns. These questions are not intended to be directed toward any specific individual, actuary, or group, but are offered solely as considerations for practicing life actuaries. Furthermore, the checklist is not intended as an instrument for rating or assessing an organization's level of governance; nor is it prescriptive in any way, and does not constitute a list of model governance requirements. There is no expectation that "yes" will always be the right answer to any of the questions posed. The answer will depend on many things, including the nature of the company, the model purpose, and the materiality of the model inputs and outputs. All questions are meant to be considerations and not a judgment that the actuary is doing a good or bad job. There may be a good reason for a "no" answer. For example, A6 asks, "Is there a training program in place to ensure users/modelers are adequately educated and capable of utilizing the modeling software?" The answer may be "no" for a small company that doesn't warrant a formal training program.

It should be further understood that many of the questions contained in this document are best comprehended by life actuaries who are involved in modeling and modeling systems management. Non-actuaries, and those lacking systems management expertise, may be ill-equipped to discern the proper context in which many of the questions apply. Consequently, any interpretation or implication derived from the application or extension of the questions contained in this list would necessitate an appropriate level of relevant experience, knowledge, and professional judgment. This would include an expectation of an understanding of terms that are commonly used in activities related to modeling. There are many terms used in this checklist that are not defined herein, because it is expected that life actuaries involved in modeling would be familiar with these terms.

The Model Governance practice note is an additional source of information for practicing life actuaries seeking to better understand models, model risks, model governance and related issues, as these actuaries implement PBR in their organizations.

# Model Governance Checklist Categories 

The checklist is divided into the following 10 categories:

A Governance Standards<br>B Modeling Process<br>C Assumptions Setting<br>D Input Data/Tables/Mapping<br>E Access Controls<br>F System/Model Changes<br>G Model Selection/Versioning<br>H Consolidation of Results<br>I Reporting<br>J Analysis/Validation

Note that "Governance Standards" and "Modeling Process" categories contain only those questions that are unique to these topics, and therefore do not appear under other categories. Questions touching on any of the remaining eight categories may be duplicated across those categories in which the question is associated.

## Color Coding

The questions are further categorized with the following color codes:

## Governance Policy/Process-Type Questions Validation-Type Questions

The governance policy/process-type questions are high level, as they typically pertain to model governance policies, procedures, and modeling practices. In contrast, the validationtype questions may entail a more hands-on assessment.

## General Guiding vs. Technical Focus Questions

Questions are further categorized under "General Guiding" vs. "Technical Focus." These two categories were difficult to assign, but this somewhat indeterminate classification is intended to aid in assessing the level of required technical knowledge associated with the respective model governance concern. With this in mind, the General Guiding questions may be more likely suited for those involved in model governance management, whereas the Technical Focus questions may be more fully comprehended by those directly involved in day-to-day modeling activities.

## Governance Standards

Color Code:

Governance Policy/Process-Type Questions

Validation-Type Questions

## General Guiding Questions

Has a model governance framework been formally developed, documented, and adopted throughout the organization?

Is senior management aware of and familiar with the governance policies?

Is there a dedicated modeling "organizational structure" having clear and delineated responsibilities for development, maintenance, execution, and change management of actuarial systems and models? Such responsibilities include:

- Inventory of models subject to governance
- Creation, maintenance, and communication of all change requests
- Management of approval process
- Integration of changes
- Coordination of testing

Have model documentation standards been established and adopted throughout the organization?

Are modeling documentation standards periodically reviewed for adequacy and utility?

Is there a training program in place to ensure users/modelers are adequately educated and capable of utilizing the modeling software?

Is there a model/system governance committee?

When discrepancies in the data, modeling, systems, or reporting are discovered, is there a process in place to document these issues and to mitigate them?

Are discovered modeling or system errors documented and archived along with their effects? (Archived error/bug documentation is a valuable resource when conducting future reconciliations and testing.) Are processes in place to correct, prevent and/or mitigate such errors?

## Questions of a More Technical Focus

A15 Is versioning software in use for data, models, and systems?

A16 Has the modeling environment been consolidated away from silos and toward a more holistic environment comprised of fewer platforms and fewer redundant models? If not feasible, have additional controls been implemented to ensure model integrity across all modeling platforms?

A17 Are the impacts of coding modifications/enhancements/corrections captured and documented?
