## Q1: How should the Average "Factor-Based" C3 Phase I Factor and Amount be determined?

A1: One limitation of the 2022 GOES field test for C3 Phase I was that there was no information  collected that would help regulators and interested parties compare the modeled C3 Phase I capital amounts to those determined by the formulaic floor. The “Factor-Based” capital amount and factor metric are required for the 2024 field test so that this comparison can be better understood.

In section LR027 of the Life RBC Blank (Attachment 1), there are two sections for A) “Reserves that were cash flow tested for asset adequacy” and B) “All Other Reserves”. Business in the scope of A) above includes a modeled amount and an amount determined by simple factors applied to statutory reserves or other balance sheet items. On the other hand, business in the scope of B) above only uses the factor-based approach  to determine a capital amount. The respective final RBC C3 requirement is the greater of:

- [ A) Model-Based Amount + B) Factor-Based Amount ] or 
- (1/2) *[ A) Factor-Based Amount + B) Factor-Based Amount ]

Given that both modeled and non-modeled business is included in the floor for reporting, there is no direct comparison between solely the A) model-based amount and a floor that only applies to that business. However, a reasonable proxy to get the respective formulaic floor would be ½ * (Line 16 + Line 17). The Factor-Based C3 Phase I factor would then be the amount described in the previous sentence divided by the respective statutory reserve. There could be some nuance to this if companies are not including all of the business in the field test that they normally would report under lines 16 and 17, so field test participants may need to adjust accordingly. Finally, companies may also wish to include the C3 amounts including the non-modeled business if the proxy-metric described above does not accurately capture their business.

## Q2: How many scenarios should be used for C3 Phase I Testing?

A2: For the participant’s baseline run, the company should use existing year-end 2023 reported results which should reflect running 50 or 12 scenarios. For each of the field test runs, participants should use a minimum of 200 scenarios for C3 Phase I. To accommodate producing C3 Phase I results using 200 scenarios, participants should use the same C3 Phase I excel-based results template that was provided for the first field test.

## Q3: In what format should results be shared during the confidential, regulator-only discussions?

A3: Participants can use their judgement to determine the exact medium they would like to use to convey their results in a concise and easy-to-understand fashion. For reference, the public presentations that were delivered as part of the first field test are located on the GOES SharePoint in the link below. Participants are encouraged to consider what additional information or displays would be helpful in sharing their company-specific results.
