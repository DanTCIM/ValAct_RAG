## Section 1: Purpose

The purpose of this section is to establish the minimum reporting requirements for policies or contracts subject to a principle-based valuation according to the methods defined in VM-20 and VM-21.

## Section 2: General Requirements

A. Each year a company shall prepare, under the direction of one or more qualified actuaries, as assigned by the company under the provisions of VM-G, a PBR Actuarial Report if the company computes a DR or a SR or performs an exclusion test for any policy as defined in VM-20, or computes an aggregate reserve for any contract as defined in VM-21.

A company that does not compute any deterministic or SR under VM-20 for a group of policies as a result of the policies in that group passing the exclusion tests as defined in VM-20 Section 6 must still develop a sub-report for that group of policies that addresses the relevant requirements of Section 3 .

A company that computes reserves under the Alternative Methodology defined in VM-21 must still develop a sub-report with the applicable requirements to the Alternative Methodology for that group of policies that addresses the relevant requirements of Section 3.

The PBR Actuarial Report shall consist of an Executive Summary, a Life Summary, a Life Report, a VA Summary, and a VA Report, as applicable. The Life Report and the VA Report shall each contain one or more sub-reports, with each such sub-report covering one or more groups of policies, model segments or contracts. Each such sub-report shall be prepared by the qualified actuary assigned responsibility for such groups of policies or contracts under the provisions of VM-G. The PBR Actuarial Report must include documentation and disclosure sufficient for another actuary qualified in the same practice area to evaluate the work.

B. The PBR Actuarial Report must include descriptions of all material decisions made and information used by the company in complying with the minimum reserve requirements and must comply with the minimum documentation and reporting requirements set forth in Section 3.

C. The Executive Summary, Life Summary and VA Summary of the PBR Actuarial Report, as provided in Section 3.B, Section 3.C and Section 3.E, shall be submitted to the company's domiciliary commissioner no later than April 1 of the year following the year to which the PBR Actuarial Report applies. The entire PBR Actuarial Report, as provided by the entirety of Section 3 , shall be submitted upon request to the company's domiciliary commissioner no later than April 1 of the year following the year to which the PBR Actuarial Report applies or within 30 days, if requested after April 1. Similarly, the company shall submit the entire PBR Actuarial Report or the Executive Summary, Life Summary and VA Summary upon request, to the commissioner of any other jurisdiction in which the company is licensed.

D. The company shall retain on file, for at least seven years from the date of filing, sufficient documentation so that it will be possible to determine the procedures followed, the analyses performed, the bases for assumptions and the results obtained in a principle-based valuation.

E. The PBR Actuarial Report shall be submitted in searchable portable document format (PDF) form, in which the narrative uses a font size no smaller than 10 point. However:

1. This requirement shall in no way preclude the use of graphs and charts.
2. As needed, large arrays of data should be submitted alongside the PDF file in the form of spreadsheets. The PDF document shall make specific reference to such accompanying files. Such companion files shall be considered part of the PBR Actuarial Report for regulatory review purposes.

## Section 3: PBR Actuarial Report Requirements

A. The PBR Actuarial Report shall contain a table of contents with associated page numbers. The PBR Actuarial Report shall retain and follow the order of the requirements listed herein. If only policies valued under VM-20 are included, then Section 3.E and Section 3.F are not applicable. If only contracts valued under VM-21 are included, then Section 3.C and Section 3.D are not applicable. The PBR Actuarial Report shall keep the corresponding headers for each requirement and include an explanatory statement for any requirement that is not applicable.

B. Executive Summary - The PBR Actuarial Report shall contain a single Executive Summary at the beginning of the report which addresses all sub-reports. The Executive Summary shall include the following:

1. Qualified Actuary - An opening paragraph identifying the qualified actuary that has been assigned by the company to prepare each sub-report of the PBR Actuarial Report, the qualifications of the qualified actuary and the relationship of the qualified actuary to the company.
2. Groups of Policies and/or Contracts - A listing of the groups of policies valued under VM-20 and/or contracts valued under VM-21 covered by each sub-report.
3. Policies - A summary of the base policies within each VM-20 reserving category. Include information necessary to fully describe the company's distribution of business. For direct business, use PBR Actuarial Report Template A located on the NAIC website (https://www.naic.org/pbr data.htm?tab 3) to provide descriptions of each base policy product type and underwriting process (including a description of the process, the time period in which it was used, and the level of any additional margin), with a breakdown of policy count and face amount by base policy product type and underwriting process. Also include the target market, primary distribution system, and key product features that affect risk, including conversion privileges.
4. Contracts - A description of the contracts valued under VM-21, including descriptions of the target market, primary distribution system, and key product features that affect risk, such as death benefit guarantees, living benefit guarantees, or any other guarantees.
