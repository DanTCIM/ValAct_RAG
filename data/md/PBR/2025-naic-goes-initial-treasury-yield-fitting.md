# NAIC GOES - Initial Treasury Yield Fitting Process

Author: ©2025 Conning, Inc. Conning, Inc

## Overview

As mentioned in the NAIC Technical Document - Interest Rates, the GEMS ${ }^{\text {® }}$ Economic Scenario Generator model does not directly model Treasury yields. Instead, it models state variables and then converts those into yields based on the selected model parameters. Since these state variables aren't observable, that leads to a question: how do we determine their initial values for any particular start date? The rest of this document will outline the process selected for the NAIC's GOES scenarios. ${ }^{1}$

One of the key advantages of the multi-factor affine model that underpins the GEMS ${ }^{\text {® }}$ Treasury model is that there are linear functions which don't change over the simulation, and these allow us to convert simulated state variables into Treasury spot rates for any tenor: ${ }^{2}$

$$
y(\tau)=\frac{-1}{\tau}\left(\left(-\int_{0}^{\tau} l(s) d s\right)+\sum_{i=1}^{3} A_{i}(\tau)+\sum_{i=1}^{3} B_{i}(\tau) X_{i}\right)
$$

To ensure consistency between the initial and the simulated yields, we will use this same function to determine the initial values for the state variables. Specifically, if we select any three tenors, then we will have three equations in three unknowns which can be solved through simple matrix algebra. However, that leaves us with another question: "How do we decide which three tenors to select?"

For a simulated scenario, any three tenors would produce the same three state values because they're all being generated by the formula above. Unfortunately, that rule doesn't apply to the initial yield curve. Therefore, the general goal of this process is to find initial state values which "best fit" the observed curve. Based on the GOES committee discussions, it was decided that this best fit would be based on the entire initial curve in order to ensure that extra weight was given to the long end of the curve that drives many life insurance results. Since this process will involve 62 tenors- 1 - and 3 month and then every 6 months out to 30 years-the basic calculation will use a regression to estimate the three state variables. Specifically, the basic process will perform the following steps:

1. Retrieve the par yields from the Treasury website ${ }^{3}$ for the selected date.
2. Use the 1-, 3-and 6-month along with the 1-, 2-, 3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, 20- and 30-year yields.
3. For all the remainder of the points, linearly interpolate between the two adjacent tenors. For example, the estimated 6.5 -year yield will equal $75 \%$ of the 7 -year plus $25 \%$ of the 5 -year yield.

[^0]4. Convert the 1-, 3-and 6-month yields directly into continuously compounded spot rates. ${ }^{4}$
5. For the remaining tenors, use the yield curve stripping routine shown in Appendix I to calculate the necessary spot rates.
6. Using the affine functions, which are fixed based on the calibration parameters, find the best fitting initial state variables using a simple regression.
7. Using those initial state variables, calculate the entire fitted yield curve.

For the December 31, 2024 yield curve, this procedure produces a fitted curve that looks like this:

In order to ensure that the simulation starts with the actual yield curve, there will be one final step in the process: determining the initial shift vector (i.e., $l(s)$ in the equation on Page 1). Since this function is assumed to be piecewise linear, we can use a similar process to the yield curve, i.e., stripping to determine the necessary adjustments at each of the 62 tenors. For the first point (i.e., the 1 -month tenor), there is no adjustment to the start of that segment (i.e., $T=0$ ), since that shift point is a fixed portion of the calibration process. Therefore, our integration converts into finding the area of a triangle with the appropriate height. Specifically, following through the math, we can

[^1]determine that the height of the adjustment must be twice the desired movement. For example, the actual 1 -month spot rate in the above example was $4.40 \%$, but the fitted spot rate was $4.52 \%$ for a difference of $-0.12 \%$. Therefore, the value of the vector at $T=1 / 12$ needs to be $-0.24 \%$ below the fitted shift. All of the remaining tenors can be calculated using a similar process, but with trapezoidal regions instead of triangles. A full example of these calculations can be found in the file, 'Initial Treasury yield Fitting Example - $2-28-25 . x$ Isx.'

## Low Yield Adjustment

In its final formulation, the GOES version will use a dynamic generalized fractional floor (dynamic GFF) to limit the frequency of negative yields in the simulation. Since we still want the output of the process (i.e., the yields after the dynamic GFF) to be well aligned with the actual yields, we will need to adjust the input spot rates to the above process if/when they are low enough. Specifically, for any initial spot rates below the dynamic GFF's threshold, we will need to solve a quadratic equation whose parameters depend on whether the final yield is above or below $0 \%$. As an example, we can look at the March $9^{\text {th }}$ start date that was used for several of the Field Test runs. On that date, the 6-month yield was $0.27 \%$; when run through this process, which implies the need for a 6-month spot rate of $-0.32 \%$, given the initial proposed parameters of the dynamic GFF. Since all of the initial yields between 3 months and 3 years on that date were below the selected threshold, this process produces the following adjusted initial spot rate curve.

## Appendix I: Yield Curve Stripping

The basis for the GOES Treasury model is continuously compounded spot rates; that is because there are linear functions, called affine functions, which can be used to convert any set of state variables into a spot rate for a specific tenor. ${ }^{5}$ In the simulation, these spot rates can then be used to price any Treasury investment simply by adding together the price of the individual cash flows. However, there is still the matter of initializing this model. Specifically, the yield curve provided by the US Treasury is stated on a par yield basis. The process of converting par yields to spot rates is called stripping the curve.

In order to strip the curve, we first need to have par yields for every cash flow. Since US Treasury Bonds pay coupons semi-annually, that means we need yields for every 6 months out to 30 years. This is why the GOES process uses linear interpolation to estimate the entire curve. Once we have this information, our goal is to calculate a price for each of these cash flows, since those prices can be easily converted into spot rates. We start with the 6-month Treasury bill; that investment only has one cash flow of $1+\frac{i_{0.5}}{2}$ at 6 months, where $i_{t}$ refers to the semi-annual par yield for tenor $t$. By definition, this par bond must have a price of 1 , so we know that $1=$ price $_{0.5} *\left(1+\frac{i_{0.5}}{2}\right)$. However, we also know that, by definition, price ${ }_{0.5}=\exp \left(-s_{0.5} * 0.5\right)$, where $s_{t}$ refers to the continuously compounded spot rate for tenor $t$. Solving these two equations gives us the following formula for the 6-month spot rate: $s_{0.5}=2 * \operatorname{LN}\left(1+\frac{i_{0.5}}{2}\right)$.

For all the longer tenors, we can use a similar iterative technique. For example, consider a $T$-Year bond, and let us assume that we have the spot rates for 0.5 through $T-0.5$ years. Then, we can break this bond's cash flow into two components: interim coupon payments and a final payment. Each of the interim payments is for $\frac{i_{0.5}}{2}$ so their total value is: $\frac{i_{T}}{2} * \sum_{j=0.5}^{T-0.5}$ price $_{j}$. The final payment includes the last coupon payment, so its value is price ${ }_{T} *\left(1+\frac{i_{0.5}}{2}\right)$. As above, this means that $1=\frac{i_{T}}{2} * \sum_{j=0.5}^{T-0.5}$ price $_{j}$ + price $_{\mathrm{T}} *\left(1+\frac{i_{0.5}}{2}\right)$. Since we know the spot rates and thus the prices for all the shorter tenors, we can solve this equation as price $_{T}=\frac{1-\frac{i_{T}}{2} * \sum_{j=0.5}^{T-0.5} \text { price }_{j}}{1+\frac{i_{T}}{2}}$. So, by repeatedly applying this process, we can convert the par yields into equivalent spot rates for tenors from 6 months to 30 years.

However, there is one final adjustment needed for the 1 - and 3 -month yields. While these bonds would be quoted on a bond equivalent basis in the market, the US Treasury's calculation quotes them on a par yield basis to be consistent with the other tenors. As a result, we need to treat these bonds as a semi-annual coupon bond, but with only a partial coupon period left. When a coupon bond is traded between coupon payments, there are two prices involved: the clean and the dirty price. The clean price is the one that gets used in the marketplace-in particular, the clean price will be 1 for a par bond-whereas the dirty price is the amount that actually gets paid by the buyer. This amount consists of the clean price plus the fraction of the coupon period that has already passed (i.e., the accrued interest). For a 1 -month par bond, that would mean the total price of the bond would be $1+ \frac{i_{0.5}}{2} *(0.5-1 / 12)$. So, following the approach used for the 6-month bill, we get that $s_{T}= \ln \left(\frac{1+i_{T} * 0.5}{1+i_{T} *(0.5-T)}\right) * \frac{1}{T}$ for these two shorter maturities.
