Current:<br>SSAP No. 7-Asset Valuation Reserve and Interest Maintenance Reserve<br>Annual Statement Instructions

## INT 23-01 Issue

1. The statutory accounting guidance for interest maintenance reserve (IMR) and the asset valuation reserve (AVR) is within *SSAP No. 7-Asset Valuation Reserve and Interest Maintenance Reserve*, but the guidance within SSAP No. 7 is very limited. It provides a general description, identifies that IMR/AVR shall be calculated and reported per the guidance in the applicable SSAP, and if not explicit in the SSAP, in accordance with the annual statement instructions. The SSAPs most often simply direct allocation to (or between) IMR and AVR, with the bulk of the guidance residing within the annual statement instructions.
2. As detailed in SSAP No. 7, paragraph 2, the guidance for IMR and AVR applies to life and accident and health insurance companies and focuses on IMR and AVR liability recognition and distinguishing between IMR and AVR:

- SSAP No. 7 Paragraph 2: Life and accident and health insurance companies shall recognize liabilities for an AVR and an IMR. The AVR is intended to establish a reserve to offset potential credit-related investment losses on all invested asset categories excluding cash, policy loans, premium notes, collateral notes and income receivable. The IMR defers recognition of the realized capital gains and losses resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. These gains and losses shall be amortized into investment income over the expected remaining life of the investments sold. The IMR also applies to certain liability gains/losses related to changes in interest rates. These gains and losses shall be amortized into investment income over the expected remaining life of the liability released.

3. The IMR guidance in the annual statement instructions provides information on the net balance. A positive IMR represents net interest rate realized gains and is reported as a liability on a dedicated reporting line. A negative disallowed IMR represents net interest rate realized losses and is reported as a miscellaneous other-than-invested write-in asset in the general account and nonadmitted.
4. IMR balances between the general account and separate accounts are separate and distinct. Meaning, a net negative IMR in the general account only represents activity that occurred in the general account that was allocated to IMR. However, the net positive or negative balance of the general account influences how the net positive or negative balances are reported in separate account statements (and vice versa). (A net negative IMR balance in the general account may not be disallowed if there is a covering net positive IMR in the separate account. Negative IMR that is not disallowed is reported as a contra-liability.) The instructions for reporting the net negative and positive balances are detailed in the annual statement instructions:

- Line 6 - $\quad$ Reserve as of December 31, Current Year

    - Record any positive or allowable negative balance in the liability line captioned "Interest Maintenance Reserve" on Page 3, Line 9.4 of the General Account Statement and Line 3 of the Separate Accounts Statement. A negative IMR balance may be recorded as a negative liability in either the General Account or the Separate Accounts Statement of a company only to the extent that it is covered or offset by a positive IMR liability in the other statement.

    - If there is any disallowed negative IMR balance in the General Account Statement, include the change in the disallowed portion in Page 4, Line 41 so that the change will be appropriately charged or credited to the Capital and Surplus Account on Page 4. If there is any disallowed negative IMR balance in the Separate Accounts Statement, determine the change in the disallowed portion (prior year less current year disallowed portions), and make a direct charge or credit to the surplus account for the "Change in Disallowed Interest Maintenance Reserve" in the write-in line, in the Surplus Account on Page 4 of the Separate Accounts Statement. The following information is presented to assist in determining the proper accounting:

| General Account <br> IMR Balance | Separate Account <br> IMR Balance | Net <br> IMR Balance |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Positive | Positive | Positive (See rule a) |
| Negative | Negative | Negative (See rule b) |
| Positive | Negative | Positive (See rule c) |
| Positive | Negative | Negative (See rule d) |
| Negative | Positive | Positive (See rule e) |
| Negative | Positive | Negative (See rule f) |

Rules:

    a. If both balances are positive, then report each as a liability in its respective statement.

    b. If both balances are negative, then no portion of the negative balances is allowable as a negative liability in either statement. Report a zero for the IMR liability in each statement and follow the above instructions for handling disallowed negative IMR balances in each statement.

    c. If the general account balance is positive, the separate accounts balance is negative and the combined net balance is positive, then all of the negative IMR balance is allowable as a negative liability in the Separate Accounts Statement.

    d. If the general account balance is positive, the separate account balance is negative, and the combined net balance is negative, then the negative amount not covered by the positive amount is not allowable. Report only the allowable portion as a negative liability in the Separate Accounts Statement and follow the above instructions for handling the disallowed portion of negative IMR balances in the Separate Accounts Statement.

    e. If the general account balance is negative, the separate account balance is positive, and the combined net balance is positive, then all of the negative IMR balance is allowable as a negative liability in the General Account Statement.

    f. If the general account balance is negative, the separate account balance is positive, and the combined net balance is negative, then the negative amount not covered by the positive amount is not allowable. Report only the allowable portion as a negative liability in the General Account Statement and follow the above instructions for handling the disallowed portion of negative IMR balances in the General Account Statement.

5. In October 2022, the ACLI requested the Statutory Accounting Principles (E) Working Group to reassess the guidance for net negative (disallowed) IMR, with a request to consider admittance of those amounts. The ACLI noted that the nonadmittance of disallowed negative IMR can have adverse negative ramifications for insurers with two key themes:

    - a. In general, rising interest rates are favorable to the financial health of the insurance industry and policyholders. However, with negative IMR, there is an inappropriate perception of decreased financial strength through lower surplus and risk-based capital.

    - b. Negative IMR could impact the rating agency view of the industry or incentivize companies to avoid prudent investment transactions that are necessary to avoid mismatches between assets and liabilities. In either scenario, negative IMR encourages short-term noneconomic activity that is not in the best long-term interest of a reporting entity's financial health or its policyholders.

6. In considering the request, the Working Group concluded that, for year-end 2022, there would be no change to statutory accounting guidance and deviations from statutory accounting principles would need to be approved via a permitted or prescribed practice. The Working Group then held company-specific educational sessions in January 2023 to receive detailed information regarding negative IMR and received a subsequent comment letter from the ACLI.
7. During the 2023 Spring National Meeting, the Working Group further discussed the topic of negative IMR and directed NAIC staff to proceed with drafting guidance for a 2023 solution and to begin work towards a long-term solution.

## INT 23-01 Discussion

8. This interpretation prescribes limited-time, optional, statutory accounting guidance, as an exception to the existing guidance detailed in SSAP No. 7 and the annual statement instructions that requires nonadmittance of net negative (disallowed) IMR as a short-term solution. Specifically, this interpretation impacts the annual statement instruction rules regarding disallowed negative IMR detailed in rules 'b,' 'd' and ' $\mathrm{f}$ ' shown in paragraph 4.
9. Reporting entities are permitted to admit net negative (disallowed) IMR with the following restrictions:

    - a. Reporting entities that qualify pursuant to paragraph 9.b., are permitted to admit net negative (disallowed) IMR up to $10 \%$ of the reporting entity's adjusted general account ${ }^{1}$ capital and surplus as required to be shown on the statutory balance sheet of the reporting entity for its most recently filed statement with the domiciliary state commissioner. The capital and surplus shall be adjusted to exclude any net positive goodwill, EDP equipment and operating system software, net deferred tax assets and admitted ${ }^{2}$ net negative (disallowed) IMR.

    - b. Reporting entities applying this interpretation are required to have a risk-based capital (RBC) greater than $300 \%$ authorized control level (ACL) after an adjustment to total adjusted capital (TAC) that reflects a reduction to remove any net positive goodwill, EDP equipment and operating system software, net deferred tax assets and admitted net negative (disallowed) IMR. Compliance with this adjusted RBC calculation shall be affirmed for all[^0]quarterly and annual financial statements for which net negative (disallowed) IMR is reported as an admitted asset in the general account or recognized as an asset in the separate accounts. Reporting entities shall provide documentation to illustrate compliance with this requirement upon state regulator request. Reporting entities with an adjusted RBC calculation of $300 \%$ ACL or lower are not permitted to admit net negative (disallowed) IMR in the general account or recognize IMR assets in the separate accounts.

    - c. The net negative (disallowed) IMR permitted for admittance shall not include losses from derivatives that were reported at fair value prior to derivative termination ${ }^{3}$ unless the reporting entity has historically followed the same process for interest-rate hedging derivatives that were terminated in a gain position. In other words, there is a requirement for documented, historical evidence illustrating that unrealized gains from derivatives reported at fair value were reversed to IMR (as a liability) and amortized as part of IMR. Reporting entities that do not have evidence of this past application are required to remove realized losses from derivatives held at fair value from the net negative (disallowed) IMR balance to determine the amount permitted to be admitted. Reporting entities that begin a new process for the use of hedging derivatives, perhaps with a theoretical process to treat derivative losses and derivative gains similarly, but do not have evidence illustrating the historical treatment of derivative gains through IMR are not permitted to include derivative losses in the net negative (disallowed) IMR permitted to be admitted. This evidence is required separately for the general account, insulated separate account and non-insulated separate account if losses from derivatives previously reported at fair value are currently being allocated to IMR in those accounts.

[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ The general account capital and surplus includes surplus reflected in the separate account; therefore, an aggregation of general account and separate account surplus is not necessary.

${ }^{2}$ As the separate account does not have "admitted" assets, broad reference to "admitted net negative (disallowed) IMR" throughout this interpretation includes what is admitted in the general account and what is recognized as an asset in the separate accounts.

10. Reporting entities that admit net negative (disallowed) IMR shall follow the following process:

    - a. All net negative (disallowed) IMR in the general account shall first be admitted until the capital and surplus percentage limit, as detailed in paragraph 9.a., is reached.

    - b. If all general account net negative (disallowed) IMR has been fully admitted, and the reporting entity is still below the paragraph 9.a. capital and surplus limit, then the reporting entity can report net negative (disallowed) IMR as an asset in the separate accounts. Reporting entities that have both insulated and non-insulated separate accounts shall recognize IMR assets proportionately between the insulated and non-insulated statements until the aggregated amount recognized as an admitted asset in the general account and as an asset in the insulated and non-insulated statements reaches the percentage limit of capital and surplus detailed in paragraph 9.a.

11. Reporting entities that admit net negative (disallowed) IMR in the general account shall report the admittance in the balance sheet as follows:

    - a. Reporting entities shall report the net negative (disallowed) IMR as an aggregate write-in to miscellaneous other-than-invested assets (line 25) (named as "Admitted Disallowed IMR") on the asset page. The net negative (disallowed) IMR shall be admitted to the extent permitted per paragraph 9.a., with the remaining net negative (disallowed) IMR balance nonadmitted.

    - b. Reporting entities shall allocate an amount equal to the general account admitted net negative (disallowed) IMR from unassigned funds to an aggregate write-in for special surplus funds (line 34) (named as "Admitted Disallowed IMR"). Although dividends are[^1]contingent on state specific statutes and laws, the intent of this reporting is to provide transparency and preclude the ability for admitted negative IMR to be reported as funds available to dividend.

[^1]:    ${ }^{3}$ Reference to derivative termination throughout this interpretation includes all actions that close out a derivative, including, but not limited to, termination, expiration, settlement, or sale.

12. Reporting entities that record net negative (disallowed) IMR as an asset in the separate account shall report the recognition in the balance sheet as follows:

    - a. Reporting entities shall report the permitted net negative (disallowed) IMR as an aggregate write-in to miscellaneous other-than-invested assets (line 15) (named as "Recognized Disallowed IMR") on the asset page.

    - b. Reporting entities shall allocate an amount from surplus equal to the asset recognized as disallowed IMR as an aggregate write-in for special surplus funds (line 19) (named as "Recognized Disallowed IMR) on the liabilities and surplus page.

13. Reporting entities admitting net negative (disallowed) IMR are required to complete the following disclosures in the annual and quarterly financial statements for IMR:

    - a. Reporting entities that have allocated gains/losses to IMR from derivatives that were reported at fair value prior to the termination of the derivative shall disclose the unamortized balances in IMR from these allocations separately between gains and losses.

    - b. Reporting entities shall complete a note disclosure that details the following:

        - i. Net negative (disallowed) IMR in aggregate and allocated between the general account, insulated separate account and non-insulated account,

        - ii. Amounts of negative IMR admitted in the general account and reported as an asset in the separate account insulated and non-insulated blank,

        - iii. The calculated adjusted capital and surplus per paragraph 9.a., and

        - iv. Percentage of adjusted capital and surplus for which the admitted net negative (disallowed) IMR represents (including what is admitted in the general account and what is recognized as an asset in the separate account).

    - c. Reporting entities shall include a note disclosure that attests to the following statements:

        - i. Fixed income investments generating IMR losses comply with the reporting entity's documented investment or liability management policies,

        - ii. IMR losses for fixed income related derivatives are all in accordance with prudent and documented risk management procedures, in accordance with a reporting entity's derivative use plans and reflect symmetry with historical treatment in which unrealized derivative gains were reversed to IMR and amortized in lieu of being recognized as realized gains upon derivative termination.

        - iii. Any deviation to 13.c.i was either because of a temporary and transitory timing issue or related to a specific event, such as a reinsurance transaction, that mechanically made the cause of IMR losses not reflective of reinvestment activities.

        - iv. Asset sales that were generating admitted negative IMR were not compelled by liquidity pressures (e.g., to fund significant cash outflows including, but not limited to excess withdrawals and collateral calls).

INT 23-01 Status

14. The consensuses in this interpretation were adopted on August 13, 2023, to provide limited-time exception guidance to SSAP No. 7 and the annual statement instruction for the reporting of net negative (disallowed) IMR. The provisions within this interpretation are permitted as a short-term solution until December 31, 2025, and will be automatically nullified on January 1, 2026.
15. The effective date of this interpretation may be adjusted (nullified earlier or with an extended effective date timeframe) in response to Statutory Accounting Principles (E) Working Group actions to establish statutory accounting guidance specific to net negative (disallowed) IMR.
16. No further discussion is planned.

## Application Guidance for Admitting / Recognizing Net Negative (Disallowed) IMR

## General Account:

1. Net negative IMR in the general account that exceeds net positive IMR in the separate accounts is considered "disallowed" general account IMR. (Determination of the disallowed IMR in the general account shall be compared against the aggregate IMR balance in all separate accounts.)
2. Net negative disallowed IMR in the general account shall be reported as an aggregate write-in for other-than-invested assets as "Admitted Disallowed IMR" on line 25 of the asset page and nonadmitted. The change in nonadmittance shall be reported on line 41 in the summary of operations.
3. To the extent the reporting entity is permitted to admit net negative disallowed IMR pursuant to the provisions in this interpretation, the reporting entity shall admit the disallowed IMR reported on line 25 of the asset page to the extent permitted, with the change in nonadmittance reflected on line 41 in the summary of operations.
4. Reporting entities shall report an amount equal to the general account admitted net negative (disallowed) IMR as an aggregate write-in for special surplus funds (line 34 of the Liabilities, Surplus an Other Funds page) named as "Admitted Disallowed IMR."
5. Reporting entities shall include note disclosures in the quarterly and annual financial statements as required in paragraph 13 of the interpretation.

## Separate Account:

6. Net negative IMR in the separate account (aggregated IMR in both insulated and non-insulated separate accounts) that exceeds net positive IMR in the general account is considered "disallowed" separate account IMR. If the aggregate separate account IMR is positive, with a negative IMR in the insulated separate account and positive IMR in non-insulated separate account (or vice versa), then the negative IMR in the insulated separate account is not permitted to be reported as an asset. In those situations, the separate account has an aggregate positive IMR balance.
7. Net negative (disallowed) IMR in the separate account permitted to be recognized as an asset, as the admittance in the general account did not utilize the full percentage of adjusted capital and surplus permitted within this interpretation, shall be proportionately divided between insulated and non-insulated separate accounts if both separate accounts are in a negative position. If the separate account IMR is an aggregate net negative, but only one separate account blank is in a negative position, then only the separate account blank with a net negative position can recognize disallowed IMR as an asset.
8. If negative IMR in the separate account has previously been recognized as a direct charge to surplus, the reporting entity shall recognize an asset as an aggregate write-in for other-than-invested assets as "Recognized Disallowed IMR" on line 15 of the separate account asset page, with an offsetting credit to surplus. This credit to surplus shall reverse the charge previously recognized. This process shall continue in subsequent quarters if additional separate account IMR is permitted as an asset to the extent IMR was previously taken as a direct charge to surplus. Once prior surplus impacts have been fully eliminated, then the entity shall follow the guidance for new net negative (disallowed) IMR as detailed in the following paragraph. If subsequent quarters result with a decline in the permitted IMR asset in the separate account, then the asset shall be credited with an offsetting charge to surplus.
9. If the reporting entity enters a net negative (disallowed) IMR position (meaning, there has not been a prior charge to surplus for net negative (disallowed) IMR), then the entity shall recognize the asset as an aggregate write-in for other-than-invested assets as "Disallowed IMR" on line 15 of the separate account balance sheet, with an offsetting credit to IMR (line 3 of the liability page) until the IMR liability equals zero. This process shall continue in subsequent quarters if additional net negative IMR is generated from operations and is permitted as an asset under the provisions of this interpretation. If subsequent quarters result with a decline in the permitted IMR asset in the separate account, then the asset shall be credited with an offsetting charge to surplus.
10. Reporting entities shall report an amount equal to the asset recognized reflecting net negative (disallowed) IMR as an aggregate write-in for special surplus funds (line 19) (named as "Recognized Disallowed IMR." This shall be included in each separate account statement (insulated and non-insulated) if net negative disallowed IMR is recognized as an asset in that statement.
11. Reporting entities shall include note disclosures in the quarterly and annual financial statements as required in paragraph 13 of the interpretation.
