It highlights the importance of understanding the purpose, risks, and benefits of such reinsurance arrangements, as well as the relevant actuarial standards and regulatory requirements. The implications are to ensure appropriate protection of U.S. life insurer policyholders and the industry through prudent risk management practices."
