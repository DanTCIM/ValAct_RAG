No specific published date is provided.\n\nPurpose and Scope: This document provides requirements for determining principle-based reserves for non-variable annuity contracts issued on or after January 1, 2025. It covers methodologies for calculating the stochastic reserve (SR) and deterministic reserve (DR), as well as exclusion tests, modeling requirements, and assumptions for contract holder behavior, mortality, expenses, and other risk factors.\n\nKey Points:\n- Defines the aggregate reserve as the stochastic reserve plus additional standard projection amounts and reserves per VM-A/VM-C requirements, less any applicable PBR credit.\n- Provides guidance on setting prudent estimate assumptions for risk factors like mortality, lapses, utilization, expenses, and asset risks.\n- Requires the use of stochastic modeling and scenarios for determining the stochastic reserve, with prescribed scenario sets and modeling guardrails.\n- Allows the option to calculate a deterministic reserve for products meeting certain criteria related to sensitivity to economic conditions.\n- Includes requirements for allocating the aggregate reserve to individual contracts.\n- Provides guidance on modeling hedging strategies and their impact on reserves.\n\nConclusions and Implications: This document aims to implement a principle-based reserving approach for non-variable annuity products, moving away from prescribed formula-based methodologies. It requires insurers to model all material risks using stochastic techniques or prudent estimate assumptions. The requirements are comprehensive and reinforce conservatism in assumption setting. Implementing VM-22 will likely increase reserves for many non-variable annuity products and require insurers to enhance their modeling capabilities and assumption governance processes. This represents a significant change in the reserving framework for this product line."

Originally published December 2009, revised July 2010.\n\nPurpose and Scope: To examine operational risk management (ORM) practices and assess the viability of ORM as a formal discipline, and determine if managing operational risk is feasible and what issues need to be addressed to effectively implement ORM within an enterprise risk management context.\n\nKey Points:\n- Defines risk formally as a measure of adverse deviation from expectation at a level of uncertainty, contrasting with the traditional informal definition of risk as an undesirable event.\n- Introduces the concept of \"Modern ORM\" as a top-down approach focusing on major risks within a comprehensive risk architecture, as opposed to the traditional bottom-up audit-based approach.\n- Explains how traditional ORM methods like risk control self-assessment fail to reveal real operational risks by focusing on routine losses rather than large infrequent losses.\n- Describes quantitative methods like modeling frequency and severity distributions to measure expected and unexpected losses.\n- Advocates combining Modern ORM principles with useful aspects of traditional methods for an integrated ORM framework.\n\nConclusions and Implications: The authors recommend insurance companies develop formal ORM programs based on Modern ORM principles to better identify, measure and mitigate key operational risks that can significantly impact financial performance. This can improve risk management effectiveness while reducing costs compared to resource-intensive traditional methods alone. Regulators should encourage this evolution for more purposeful, value-adding ORM.\n\nKey words: operational risk, risk management, expected loss, unexpected loss, frequency, severity"

        "summary": "Title: Mechanics of Dividends\n\nPublisher and Published Date: Society of Actuaries Research Institute, March 2022\n\nPurpose and Scope: This paper concerns policyholder dividends on traditional participating life insurance products in regulatory contexts similar to those in the United States and Canada. It aims to provide an overview of how dividends work, the process of setting dividends, different dividend methods and formulas, considerations in allocating dividends, and other related topics.\n\nKey Points:\n- Dividends are a distribution of surplus no longer needed to be retained by the insurer, allocated to individual policies according to the Contribution Principle.\n- The process involves determining aggregate divisible surplus, adopting a dividend scale, and distributing dividends to policies based on the scale.\n- Common dividend methods include Contribution Method, Experience Premium Method, Asset Share Method, and Fund Method.\n- Illustrative dividend formulas like three-factor and experience premium formulas are provided.\n- Considerations include different perspectives on \"fair and equitable\" allocation, relationships between existing and new business, regulatory effects, and special situations like closed blocks.\n\nConclusions and Implications: The paper highlights the complexities and various approaches in determining and allocating dividends fairly and equitably, while balancing regulatory requirements, practical constraints, and the insurer's ability to serve the public. It provides insights into the mechanics of dividends, which is crucial for actuaries working with participating products and dividend determination.\n\nKey words: Dividends, participating insurance, contribution principle, dividend methods, dividend formulas, closed blocks."
