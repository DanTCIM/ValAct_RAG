No specific published date is provided.\n\nPurpose and Scope: This document provides requirements for determining principle-based reserves for non-variable annuity contracts issued on or after January 1, 2025. It covers methodologies for calculating the stochastic reserve (SR) and deterministic reserve (DR), as well as exclusion tests, modeling requirements, and assumptions for contract holder behavior, mortality, expenses, and other risk factors.\n\nKey Points:\n- Defines the aggregate reserve as the stochastic reserve plus additional standard projection amounts and reserves per VM-A/VM-C requirements, less any applicable PBR credit.\n- Provides guidance on setting prudent estimate assumptions for risk factors like mortality, lapses, utilization, expenses, and asset risks.\n- Requires the use of stochastic modeling and scenarios for determining the stochastic reserve, with prescribed scenario sets and modeling guardrails.\n- Allows the option to calculate a deterministic reserve for products meeting certain criteria related to sensitivity to economic conditions.\n- Includes requirements for allocating the aggregate reserve to individual contracts.\n- Provides guidance on modeling hedging strategies and their impact on reserves.\n\nConclusions and Implications: This document aims to implement a principle-based reserving approach for non-variable annuity products, moving away from prescribed formula-based methodologies. It requires insurers to model all material risks using stochastic techniques or prudent estimate assumptions. The requirements are comprehensive and reinforce conservatism in assumption setting. Implementing VM-22 will likely increase reserves for many non-variable annuity products and require insurers to enhance their modeling capabilities and assumption governance processes.

This regulatory arbitrage opportunity has driven the appetite for Combo Notes, particularly in the low interest rate environment. The document highlights the potential risks and implications of this investment strategy for regulatory and practical purposes in the actuarial field."

It covers topics such as level of aggregation, cash flow assumptions, discount rates, claim reserves, limited-payment contracts, deferred acquisition costs, and reinsurance.\n\nKey Points:\n\n- Contracts must be grouped into quarterly or annual cohorts based on issue year for calculating reserves. Considerations for defining cohorts are provided.\n\n- Cash flow assumptions like mortality, morbidity, terminations must be reviewed and updated at least annually using current best estimates without provisions for adverse deviation.\n\n- Discount rates must use an upper-medium grade (low credit risk) fixed-income instrument yield that reflects the duration characteristics of the liabilities.\n\n- Claim reserves and long-tail liabilities for long-duration health contracts are part of the liability for future policy benefits calculation under the new guidance.\n\n- For limited-payment contracts, a deferred profit liability tracks profits emerged over the premium paying period.\n\n- Deferred acquisition costs are amortized on a constant level basis over the life of the contracts, with no interest accrual. Methods for individual contracts and grouped contracts are outlined.\n\n- Reinsurance recoverable calculations follow similar principles as the direct liabilities, with additional specific considerations covered.\n\nConclusions and Implications: The ASU 2018-12 guidance represents the most significant change to GAAP insurance accounting in decades.
